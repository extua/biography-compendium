Jack Killen

A long-term Bradford Communist and activist in the TGWU bus workers branch.

Under the rule which became operative in 1950, he was debarred as a member of the Communist Party from holding office in the union.

Somewhat ironically, that very year, he was presented with a gold medal, inscribed: “For long and fairhful service to the 9/8 branch TGWU”.

After Killen retired from work, he remained very active in the Communist Party, locally.
