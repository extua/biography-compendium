John Evans

Evans was a member of the Communist Party in Battersea and chair of the highly vigorous Battersea Tenants’ Association. This even made a film in 1961, entitled “H only for House”, a reference to the major anti H-bomb campaign.

John Evans was the Communist Party candidate for Battersea North in the London County Council elections of 1961. This was fought by the Communist Party primarily on the questions of the lack of council housing and high rents.

Other Communist candidates in 1961 included Solly Kane (Stepney), Joe Bent (Southwark), Jock Nicolson (St Pancras North) and John Moss (Islington South West).
