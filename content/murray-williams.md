Murray Williams

Williams was a Communist miner in the Rhondda, South Wales, who was described by the Daily Worker, on his death, as one of Wales’ “outstanding Working Class Leaders”.

For three decades the active leader of the men at Lewis Merthyr Lodge of the South Wales Miners Federation and later the National Union of Miners, he was also a union compensation secretary.  
  
For several years Murray Williams was an elected Communist Councillor on Rhondda Borough Council.  
  
In later years he suffered from poor health aggravated by a pit accident many years previous.  
  
Murray Williams died in February 1961 leaving a wife and grown up son.  
  
His funeral, on 14th February, was a vivid display of Welsh Communist miners’ solidarity.
