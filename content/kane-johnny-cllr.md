Councillor Johnny Kane

Johnny Kane was a Communist County councillor for Renton, in the Vale of Leven, from the 1940s until his death in the late 1950s.

Described by local history sources as “one of Renton's great 20th century characters”, Kane has a street named after him.  Kane Street, in Renton, is a more of a thoroughfare, built as part of the 1960s redevelopment. Local sources comment that: “It is a very small street for such a large personality.”
