His view on 1939 was that it was an “absolute paramount question” to support the only socialist state.

Lon served in the army in the war.

He was a teacher and in 1945, he wrote a 28 page pamphlet for the International Brigade Association IBA and a similar account of opposition in Spain for Labour Monthly in 1948.

On the 25th anniversary of the outbreak fo the Spanish war, in August 1961, Marxism Today carried a major piece by him.
