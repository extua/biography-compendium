Initially a bakers’ boy, a circus worker, boxer and a miner, Sprague worked for the Daily Worker and the Morning Star. 

He then became, variously, a print-maker, poster designer, painter, cartoonist, sculptor, muralist, banner maker, television presenter, psycho-drama specialist and teacher.

Sprague was winner of the poster of the year award from the National Council of Industrial Design twice.

For many years was the editor of the T&G journal, the Record.

A BBC omnibus film devoted to him was entitled \`The Posterman’.

This led on to him presenting a TV series for BBC South West, called “Everyone a Special Kind of Artist” and then, with Joan Bakewell, “The Moving Line”.

 He died on 25th July 2004, aged 77.
