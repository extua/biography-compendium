Eden Paul

Born Maurice Eden Paul in 1865 in Dorset, he was the younger son of the publisher Charles Kegan Paul.

A medical doctor, Eden Paul was educated at University College London and the London Hospital.

He was associated with Beatrice Webb and also Charles Booth's enquiry into poverty in the east end of London.

From 1892 to 1894, he taught at a university in Japan.

From 1907 to 1919, he was a member of the ILP, and worked for the French Socialist Party from 1912 to 1914. By 1918, both he and his second wife, Cedar Paul (see separate entry) were writing pieces for the British Socialist Party press.  Eden joined the British Communist Party on its foundation as did Cedar.

Together with Cedar, he wrote several books and they also worked together to translate from German, French, Italian and Russian.

Marx's \`The eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte' was translated from the German into English by Eden & Cedar Paul and published in 1926. In 1928 the husband and wife team produced a new translation of the \`Manifesto of the Communist Party’ for publishers Martin Lawrence (later Lawrence and Wishart); a new translation of ‘Capital’ followed in 1929. 

By the time the 1930s arrived, the Paul’s had begun to live in Paris all the time and Eden Paul died on 1st December 1944.
