_(pic left) Jim Grady in 1939_

Grady was born in Wigan and worked in the mines for 17 years. He was involved in major strikes, becoming victimized because of his trade union activity.

He became involved in unemployed movement activities in the early 1930s, being batoned by the police during unemployment demonstrations.

Visiting the Soviet Union in the 1930s, he was Communist Party organiser for South East Lancashire and North East Lancashire and later Merseyside in the late 1930s.
