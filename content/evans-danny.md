Danny Evans

Evans came into contact with the Communist Party more by accident than design. He was walking down a road in Cardiff, reading the Daily Worker as he went, when he was spotted doing this by Vivian Smith, who had been an active member of the Minority Movement.

Despite the name, one set of Evans’ grandparents had come from Kilarney and the connection was of importance. 

Evans moved, like so many Welshmen, to Oxford to take advantage of the work opportunities that came from advancing industrialisation in that city.

He was a long-term and loyal member of the Communist Party who was interviewed, amongst other veterans, as part of an Oxford branch Communist Party project, by Gwyneth Francis on 19th October 1986.
