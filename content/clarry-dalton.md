Clarry Dalton

Dalton came from Moston in Manchester and had joined the ETU in 1938. He and his two brothers, also electricians, had 70 years continuous membership of the union between them when Clarry found himself barred from office as a result of the right-wing anti-communist purge from 1965.

A steward, he had represented his union on the local trades council for four years, on the area committee for six and at the annual conference for 12 years; after his first election he was returned unopposed thereafter.
