Evelyn Howley

A cotton mill worker from "Red" Colne, Lancashire, Evelyn Howley joined the Communist party after hearing Rose Smith (see separate entry) speak during the 1931/1932 cotton strikes.

She later stated that she joined the Communist Party because: "It was the struggle, poverty ... I think when you get so low, you don't know which way to turn ... you either sink lower or you stand and fight ... you begin to think for yourself."
