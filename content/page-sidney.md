Sidney Page

A life-long Communist, Sid Page taught English at Stonehill High School in Leicester for 25 years, having previously worked at Roundhill School.

When he became President of NUT Mid-Leicestershire Association in 1976, he said that: “Cutting education is unlike cutting anything else. A temporary shortage or cut can be made up later, but you cannot replace the missed years of a child’s education.”

Sadly, he died in October 1981, only a year after he retired, aged 65.
