Louie Davies

A colourful and charismatic individual, Louie Davies was - along with her husband Bob - an active Lancashire Communist from the 1920s, especially during the General Strike and during the unemployed struggles of the 1930s.

A textile worker, in her later years Louie later worked as a machinist in the garment trade.

She achieved 100% organisation in every factory she worked in and remained steadfast to her principles to her death on February 9th 1994.
