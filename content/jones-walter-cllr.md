Walter Jones (Cllr)

Walter Jones won a seat as a councillor as a Communist Party candidate in Risca, a small town that is today part of the Newport conurbation, lying at the south-eastern edge of the South Wales coalfield.

Jones’ victory in 1958 came with 1,247 votes, in what was described as a “well-organised campaign”.

One of the extraordinary highlights was the sale of 263 copies of the British Road to Socialism in Risca ward, which equated to a sale of one per three houses.
