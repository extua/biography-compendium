Frances Armstrong Paterson joined the Communist Party in Glasgow in 1922 and, in 1930, became a partner of the Workers Press, the company that produced the Daily Worker.

In this capacity, he was charged in July 1930 with contempt of court and sentenced to six months imprisonment when the paper was said to have "lowered the authority of Mr Justice Swift" in one of its editorials. The following year, when the Daily Worker published a sailors' manifesto at the time of the Invergordon Mutiny, Paterson was sentenced to two year's in jail under an Act of 1797. On his release, he continued his work for the paper, first in the Advertising Department and later as a sub-editor.

After leaving the paper in 1960, he worked for the Chinese and Czechoslovakian news agencies and retired in 1972.

Paterson died aged 79 on June 2nd 1986.
