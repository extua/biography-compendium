Monty Berkeley

Monty Berkeley was a Scottish Communist active for six decades in the Party and the wider labour movement from the 1930s.

He worked “mainly in books” and was famed for his encouragement of younger comrades to read Marxist classics. In his later years he was much involved with the Britain-GDR Friendship Society and in solidarity work for Cuba.

He was in his 80s when he died in October 1993.
