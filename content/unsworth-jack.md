Jack Unsworth

Jack Unsworth was one of two sons of staunch Marxist socialist Bill Unsworth, the champion marker-off in the boiler shop at Gorton Tank in Manchester that Harry Pollitt learned his trade in. According to Pollitt, Unsworth was "a marvellous craftsman though totally withoutÂ book learning".  
  
Jack Unsworth was himself a plater and a member of the Gorton branch of the Boilermakers Society. He was the Propaganda Secretary for Openshaw Socialist Society and his wife taught at the Openshaw Socialist Sunday School. It was Jack Unsworth who proposed Harry Pollitt for membership of the Boilermakers Society in December 1911 after he had completed his apprenticeship.
