Sam Syers

Born Colin Paul Syers in Edgware, London, he was the youngest of three sons of John, a tool and clockmaker, and Rose. He acquired the nickname Sam at Kingsbury grammar.

From schooldays, his political interest was intense, joining the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and then, inspired by a speech from Jimmy Reid (see separate entry), the Young Communist League.

After leaving school, he joined the Greater London council’s street-naming section.  Sam met his wife, Themi, at a dance after they had attended a CND march in 1967 and they married six months later.

His politics and interest in journalism led to him joining the Morning Star as a subeditor around this time, when he also joined the Communist Party. But he drifted away from the Party some time after he joined the Hampstead & Highgate Express in north London on 4th January 1971 as a sub-editor, rapidly being promoted to chief subeditor, eventually becoming deputy editor until emphysema forced his retirement at the age of 54.

He died at the age of 67 in 2011.
