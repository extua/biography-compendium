Peter Nicholas

Born in Worcester in 1914, he began work at the age of fourteen at the Star Motor Company and gained skills as a universal grinder. In 1943, he became a member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and, five years later, he became an employee of the Rover company. It is likely that he joined the Communist Party in this period.

In the same year, 1948, he secured election both as a shop steward and as an AEU convenor and became Secretary of the Joint Shop Stewards' Committee. A leading member of the Rover Combine Committee, he joined the British Leyland Trade Union Combine and became its treasurer on the acquisition of Rover by Leyland in 1967.

Peter Nicholas maintained a long-standing personal interest in the cause of disabled people.
