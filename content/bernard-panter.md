Bernard Panter

As a shop steward, he led workers from the Shell Carrington site in 1968 to a mass picket at the Roberts Arundel factory in Stockport. In the early 1970s, as a full-time officer of the AEU, he and John Tocher led a series of one day strikes against the Industrial Relations Act.

Panter later played a leading role in the rolling strike action by engineering workers in the north-west of England, which forced employers to concede pay increases, a shorter working week and moves towards equal pay.

Later still, he became the national leader of the National Association of Licensed House Managers, before taking up an appointment with the Industrial Society.

He died aged 69 in 1994
