Kinsman McQueen

A full time paid \`Daily Worker' canvasser and sales organiser for Scotland in the mid-late 1930s. (The other full time Daily Worker canvassers were Bill Louden and Ernie Benson for England and Dai Maggs part-time agent in Wales.)

So successful were the sales of the paper in Scotland, a Scottish edition of the Daily Worker, printed locally, was started in November 1940 and was sustained for some years with a circulation of 12-14,000.
