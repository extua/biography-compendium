Charlie Job

Charles Edward Job was born in Holborn on the 19th December 1915 and having joined the Party in his youth, he spent the war working at Woolwich Arsenal.

In the post-war period, an electrical fitter and an ETU shop steward at Deptford East Power Station, Job was Chair of the Bexley Communist Party, and a popular lecturer on social, economic and political subjects. 

A member of the Education Committee of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society, Job was aged 35 when he stood as Communist Party Parliamentary candidate for Bexley in 1950, securing 481 votes.

Charles became a significant activist in the Co-op movement, describing them in 1961 as a “major weapon of the working class against the monopoly menace”. Until 1965, Bexley was part of the Kent Communist Party district, when it became part of the Greater London area.

In 1975, he wrote a major piece for _Commen_t, the Party weekly, on how the co-operative movement could help the struggle against the major monopolies.

He died in Hackney in 2006.
