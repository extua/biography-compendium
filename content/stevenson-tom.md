Tom Stevenson

Stevenson was an engineering worker and shop steward for the AEU.

An active Communist Party member in Newcastle, he stood as a Communist candidate in a Newcastle City Council by election in July 1961 for the St Anthony's ward, along with fellow Communist candidate Ted Rowlands (see separate entry).

The by-election occurred because two Labour Councillors had been made Aldermen. There was then a 30-30 division of councillors on the council between Tory and Labour and much public controversy over Labour's action in taking all the Aldermanic seats.

Stevenson had stood in the same ward in May 1961, securing 301 votes and pushing the Tory candidate to the bottom of the poll.
