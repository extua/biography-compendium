Dr John Lewis

In the 1930s, Lewis gave up his place as a Unitarian minister in Ipswich to take on the task of building a national network of Left Book Club discussion groups.

During the Second World War, he was a teacher with the Army Bureau of Current Affairs.

He was married to Betty Reid (see separate entry), a long term functionary in the Communist Partyâ€™s Organisation Department.
