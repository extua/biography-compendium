Maida Beasley

Born in 1899, Maida was from Scottish background. She joined Communist Party in the 1930s and was a founder member of the West Middlesex District Committee.

She became a key organiser in factories in Acton in the war years. But was known as Maida Co-op Beasley locally due to her intensive commitment to the co-operative movement. A supporter of the Morning Star, she died in 1985
