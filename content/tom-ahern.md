Tom Ahern

Born in Ireland, Tom Ahern joined the Communist Party in the late 1930s and served in the armed forces in the Second World War. He was a member of the London District Committee of the Party and a parliamentary candidate.

A leading member of the NUR, he was for 16 years the vice-president of the London Committee and a member of the national executive. Retaining strong links with his native land, Ahern was, over the years, much involved in anti-imperialist solidarity activity with the Irish anti-imperialist struggle.

He died in July 1988, aged 83.
