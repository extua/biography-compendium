Joan was born in Denton, Manchester, in 1919 into a family of working class Communists. Her parents and grandfather were founder members of the Party and she was involved in the Communist Party for most of her life fighting for many causes.

In 1978, she was one of the founder members of the Manchester TUC Pensioners Association. She was treasurer of this organisation for many years working alongside Tom, her husband, until his death.

She then took over as secretary and treasurer until 2001, when poor health made it difficult to carry on. She continued to be politically active and her last protest was the Stop the War demonstration in Manchester in September 2006. Joan Powell died on July 14 aged 88.
