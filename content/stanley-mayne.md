Stanley Mayne

Mayne began his political education in the Socialist Sunday School in south-east London.

As a clerical officer, he was active in the Civil Service Association, of which he was an executive member. He played a key role in the ultimately victorious campaign for direct promotion in the civil service through the clerical grades to administrative status.

He became general secretary of the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, the creation of which he was known as the architect, and remained in post until his retirement in 1961. A life-long supporter of the Daily Worker and Morning Star, he died in 1988.
