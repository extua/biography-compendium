Jack Iliffe

Jack Illiffe was a Communist Party activist during the 1930s who spoke regularly in Leicester's Market Place. When he appeared in court, following a Blackshirts’ meeting, he described himself as a propagandist. 

He was active in the local National Unemployed Workers Movement and in 1935 was campaigning to get trade union rates of pay paid the unemployed who worked on work schemes. At that time a Leicester corporation worker got 50/- for a 48 hour week, whilst unemployed on the same work got 7/- in cash and a 7/- food ticket for 36 hours.
