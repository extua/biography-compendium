Tom Mann was of one [British trades unionism’s most famous figures. He was born on 15th April 1856, in what is now a suburb of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") [Coventry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry "Coventry"), the son of a clerk who worked at a [colliery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colliery "Colliery"). He attended school from the ages of six to nine, then began work doing odd jobs on the colliery farm. A year later he became a trapper, a labour-intensive jobs that involved clearing blockages from the narrow airways in the mining shafts. In [1870](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1870 "1870"), the colliery was forced to close and the family moved to [Birmingham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham "Birmingham"). Mann soon found work as an engineering apprentice and when he had finished with this, in [1877](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1877 "1877"), he moved to [London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London").

Initially, he was unable to find work as an engineer and took a series of unskilled jobs. In [1879](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1879 "1879"), Mann found work in an engineering shop. Here he was introduced to [socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") decided to improve his own education. His reading included the works of [William Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris "William Morris"), [Henry George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George "Henry George") and [John Ruskin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin "John Ruskin"). In [1881](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1881 "1881") he joined the [Amalgamated Society of Engineers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgamated_Engineering_and_Electrical_Union "Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union"), and took part in his first strike. In [1884](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1884 "1884"), he joined the [Social Democratic Federation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Federation "Social Democratic Federation") (SDF) in [Battersea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battersea "Battersea"). Here he met [John Burns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burns "John Burns") and [Henry Hyde Champion](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Hyde_Champion&action=edit "Henry Hyde Champion"), who encouraged him to publish a pamphlet calling for the working day to be limited to eight hours. Mann formed an organisation, the Eight Hour League, which successfully pressured the [TUC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUC "TUC") to adopt the [eight-hour day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_hour_day "Eight hour day") as a key goal.

After reading the [Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Manifesto "Communist Manifesto") in [1886](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1886 "1886"), Mann became an avowed communist and never lost his belief in Marxism. When he moved to [Newcastle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne "Newcastle upon Tyne"), he organised the SDF in the north of England, and also managed [Keir Hardie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Hardie "Keir Hardie")'s electoral campaign in [Lanark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanark "Lanark") before returning to London in [1888](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1888 "1888"), where he worked in support of the [Bryant and May match factory strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bryant_and_May_match_factory_strike&action=edit "Bryant and May match factory strike"). With Burns and Champion, he began producing a journal, the [Labour Elector](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Labour_Elector&action=edit "Labour Elector") in [1888](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1888 "1888").

Along with Burns and [Ben Tillett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Tillett "Ben Tillett"), Mann was one of the leading figures in the [London Dock Strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Dock_Strike_%281889%29 "London Dock Strike (1889)") in 1889. He was responsible for organising relief for the strikers and their families. With the support of other unions and various organisations, the strike was successful. Following the strike, Mann was elected President of the newly-formed [Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock%2C_Wharf%2C_Riverside_and_General_Labourers%27_Union "Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union"), with Tillett as General Secretary. Tillett and Mann wrote a pamphlet called \`[New Unionismwas also elected to the London](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_Unionism&action=edit "New Unionism") ’. Mann [Trades and Labour Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_council "Labour council") and as secretary of the [National Reform Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Reform_Union&action=edit "National Reform Union"), and was a member of the [Royal Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission "Royal Commission") on labour from [1891](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1891 "1891") to [1893](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1893 "1893").

In [1894](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1894 "1894"), he was a founding member of the [Independent Labour Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party "Independent Labour Party") and became its Secretary in [1894](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1894 "1894"). He was an unsuccessful candidate for the party in the [1895 General Election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1895 "United Kingdom general election, 1895"). In [1896](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1896 "1896") he was beaten in the election for Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He helped create the [International Transport Workers' Federation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transport_Workers%27_Federation "International Transport Workers' Federation"), and was its first President. He was deported from a number of European countries for organising trade unions.

In [1901](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1901 "1901"), Mann emigrated to [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia "Australia") _(pic above taken in Australia)_ to see if that country's broader electoral franchise would allow more "drastic modification of capitalism". Settling in [Melbourne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne "Melbourne") he was active in Australian trade unions and became an organiser for the [Australian Labor Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party "Australian Labor Party"). However, he grew disillusioned with the party, believing it was being corrupted by the nature of government and concerned only with winning elections. He felt that the federal Labour MPs were unable and unwilling to change society, and their prominence within the movement was stifling and over-shadowing organised labour. He resigned from the ALP and founded the [Victoria Socialist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Victoria_Socialist_Party&action=edit "Victoria Socialist Party"). ![](http://79.170.40.183/grahamstevenson.me.uk/images/stories/Mann%20Tom%202.JPG) 

Returning to Britain in [1910](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1910 "1910"), Mann wrote \`_The Way to Win’_, which argued that socialism could only be achieved through trade unionism and co-operation. He founded the [Industrial Syndicalist Education League](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Industrial_Syndicalist_Education_League&action=edit "Industrial Syndicalist Education League"), and worked as an organiser for Ben Tillett. He led the [Liverpool transport strike of 1911](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liverpool_transport_strike_of_1911&action=edit "Liverpool transport strike of 1911"), after which he was convicted of sedition. His prison sentence was quashed after public pressure. He was opposed to Britain's involvement in the [first World War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and, in [1917](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917 "1917"), he joined the British Socialist Party.

In [1919](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919 "1919") he again ran for election as Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and was this time successful. He held the post until [1921](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921 "1921"), when he retired at the age of sixty-five. He welcomed the [Russian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution "Russian Revolution") and called for [soviets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_%28council%29 "Soviet (council)") to be formed in Britain. In [1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920 "1920"), he was a founder member of the [Communist Party.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain "Communist Party of Great Britain") Tom Mann was chairman of the [National Minority Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minority_Movement "National Minority Movement"), from its formation in 1924 to 1929.

Mann continued to campaign for socialism publishing pamphlets and speakign at meetings in Britain and abroad, and he was arrested for sedition on several more occasions. He continued to be a popular figure in the labour movement, attracting large audiences to rallies and benefits. During the [Spanish Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") he wanted to fight on the Republican side, but was by that time far too old. A unit of the [International Brigade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brigade "International Brigade"), the Tom Mann Centuria, was named in his honour.

Tom Mann _(pictured speaking in Trafalgar Square)_ died on the [13th March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_13 "March 13") [1941](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941 "1941").
