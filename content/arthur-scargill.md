Best known, of course, for his leadership of the National Union of Mineworkers, Arthur Scargill joined the Young Communist League in 1956.

He was Chair of the Yorkshire District of the YCL and a delegate to the World Youth Festival of 1957.

As a Communist local government election candidate in 1960, he got 138 votes, or 14.5% of the vote.

Scargill joined his NUM branch committee that same year and subsequently failed to renew his YCL membership card in 1963.
