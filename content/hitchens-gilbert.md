Gilbert Hitchings

A native of Bristol, he joined the Communist Party in 1928. He became very prominent in the marches of the unemployed from South Wales through Bristol to London in the 1920s and 1930s.

He finally obtained regular work and became elected a member of the AEU National Committee from 1937 to 1940.

Elected to the EC of the AEU in 1943 he was re-elected until the Cold War intervened in 1952, when he failed to be re-elected.

He returned to his native Bristol to work in an engineering factory as a turner, but died only a year later.
