Vic Marney

Marney was a leading Communist Party member, who worked in London docks and was active in the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) in the period after the Second World War.

He became the Secretary of the unofficial rank-and-file TGWU Liaison Committee for dockers and also of the National Trade Union Liaison Committee, which joined TGWU dockers with activists in the Waterways and Lightermen’s union, which later merged with the TGWU.
