Effie O'Hare

With her husband, Dan O'Hare, Effie was part of the Communist Party leadership in the Vale of Leven and Dunbarton area, which was able to win a significant electoral voice for the Party in the post-war period, including many councillors. Indeed, the Vale was noted for its huge Communist presence and outstanding sales of the Daily Worker.

Effie kept the flag flying long after many of her contemporaries had pre-deceased her, playing a role in speaking of the great struggles of the past in local schools and campaigning against the nuclear base on the Clyde not so far from where she lived.

Effie was in her 90s when she died in 1999, after a lifetime's commitment to Communism.
