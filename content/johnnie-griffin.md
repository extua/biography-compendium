Johnnie Griffin

Johnnie Griffin was a foundation member of the first Communist Group in Belfast, which was set up with the help of Arthur Horner.

From the Nationalist tradition, Griffin was a firm advocate of a united Ireland and a life long member of the Communist Party in Britain.

Coming to Birmingham to find work in the 1930s, after victimisation in Belfast, he was a long-standing member of the AEU.

Johnnie Griffin played a key role in Birmingham's Great Rent Strike of 1939 in the Kingstanding ward, along with Sid and Lil Atkin.

He served in the forces in the Middle East during the Second World War and died in the late 1970s.
