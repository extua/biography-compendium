Jack Collins

Member of the NEC of the NUM and later the Area Secretary of the Kent Area of the NUM, Collins was a member of Communist Party until 1983, when he allowed his membership to lapse partly in protest at the direction that CPGB was then taking and also due to differences over candidates for union posts in the Kent Area. His basic political position did not change however. Collins died in 1987, aged 57.
