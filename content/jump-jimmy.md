 Jimmy R Jump

Born on 24th August 1916 as James R Jump, the young Jimmy Jump went to Wallasey Grammar School on the Wirral.

After school he became a reporter on the Wallasey Chronicle, and later the Worthing Herald.

He was a member of the Labour League of Youth but had also joined the Communist Party.  In 1937, he volunteered for the International Brigade, which he joined on 15th November 1937.

His knowledge of languages led him to a job at Brigade Headquarters in Albacete. Later he joined the British Battalion as they undertook the Ebro offensive.  Jump later married a Spanish Republican refugee.

He self-published a volume of poems from his Spanish years in the 1980s, later more professionally re-published by his son, also named Jim Jump.
