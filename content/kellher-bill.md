Bill Kellher

Kellher was a locally well-known Brodsworth miner who was a delegate to the Yorkshire Area Council of the NUM.

He lived at 17 Riveria Mount, Doncaster, and was a Communist council candidate for the Toll-Bar ward of Bentley Urban District Council. There, in 1946, he secured a very creditable 213 votes to Labour's winning 277 votes, thus only narrowly loosing.  
  
Kellher stated:  “Years ago it was a pleasant spot with just the right semi-rural atmosphere, but things changed. Floods from the Rover Don, subsidence through mine workings, allied to destroy the ideal spot.” The Communist Party response was to demand repairs were carried out but in the longer term a new village was what was needed. "A modern village with fine houses and providing full requirements for an alert intelligent and communal minded populace"
