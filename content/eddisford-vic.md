Eddisford was a leading member of the Young Communist League in his youth and came from Manchester. He is pictured here in 1950. 

He was a long-time full time official for the Communist Party becoming its North West District Secretary (the pic on the left bottom was taken when he held this role) and ending up as its National Election Agent.

Eddisford is pictured below in the Manchester Gorton constituency by-election campaign of 1967 with a team of Young Communist League activists.
