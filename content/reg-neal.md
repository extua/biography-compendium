Reg Neal

A prominent member of the Hayes, West Middlesex Communist Party, R.P. (Reg) Neal was a popular local teacher at Yeading and secretary of the Hayes Left Book Club, which he established in October 1937. Neal was active in local Aid to Spain movement, based at the Hayes Labour Hall, he became the Chair of the local Labour Party in the late 1930s and was at the forefront of the campaign against war.

He joined the Communist Party just prior to the start of the Second World War and subsequently served in the Royal Air Force in North Africa, rising to the rank of Flying Officer. His prominent role in local campaigns, war record and good looks contributed to him being the most successful candidate of the borough in the local elections of 1946, missing a seat by less than 100 votes.

His appointment in October 1950 to the Headship of Bounds Green School, led to Conservative controlled Middlesex County Council refusing to endorse his appointment, and then imposing a blanket ban on the appointment of Communists or Fascists to Headships. This also affected fellow teacher and Communist G.C.T. Giles.

It is believed that Reg Neal later secured a headship in Sheffield.
