Terry Dickman  
  
Dickman was a prominent member of the Young Communist League in the years prior to the Second World War and a star seller of its journal, \`Challenge’ from when it first appeared in 1935. He was a member of the Hampstead YCL branch in North London Young Communist League branch, which met near Whitstone Pond and held regular open-air meetings every Sunday, with three Challenge sellers at every meeting. By 1939, this activity had developed into a United Youth platform. Challenge was also sold, along with the Daily Worker regularly at Friday meetings on the High Road in Hampstead.  
  
When he became unemployed, Dickman had decided to spend as much time as possible to supporting Challenge.  He delivered it right across the whole of North London, in an area as wide apart as Ealing and Hackney. “Even when I am not going to a meeting I try to carry half a dozen Challenges with me, because I have sold them in trains and buses, and to the attendants in cinemas, and of course to Daily Worker sellers and readers.
