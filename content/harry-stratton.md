Harry Stratton

A life-long Communist, Stratton was a member of the International Brigade in Spain and served on the Management Committee of the Daily Worker and Morning Star from 1959 to 1973 and again in the late 1970s.

He was involved politically in Swansea up to his death, was the Morning Star organiser in Llanelli, a member of the West Wales Area Committee and the Welsh Committee of the Communist Party.

Later, he joined the re-established Communist Party of Britain. A long-time member of the Transport and General Workers Union, he organised a group of local taxi drivers into membership. He died aged 84 in 1989.
