Sid Ward

Sid Ward was a key member, along with Paxton Chadwick, in the famous Communist Party branch in Leiston, Suffolk.

He was helping to produce the Communist Party journal, the Leiston Leader, as late as March 1989. That edition covered issues such as Sizewell B, noise from the local railway line, council reports and the lack of local affordable housing.

Sid Ward was a life-long member of the Communist Party and supporter of Daily Worker and Morning Star, dying in 1990.
