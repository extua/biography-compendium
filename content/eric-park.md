Eric Park

Eric Park was active for over 50 years in YCL and Communist Party in Scotland.

He was active in the Clyde Apprentices Committee in a major strike wave in his youth. The Economic League reported to the Engineering Employer's Federation in 1952 that Eric Park, Jimmy Reid's successor as secretary of the CAC, was an apprentice engineering draughtsman, the son of a long-time CP mother, a "wearer of very powerful lensed glasses, indicating bad sight" and a YCL member!

After some years working as an engineering worker he later became a lecturer at Glasgow college.

He was active in CND and Medical Aid for Cuba in retirement and died aged 73 in 2002, retaining his support for Communism to the end of his life.
