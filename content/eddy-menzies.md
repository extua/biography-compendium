Eddy Menzies

One of the first members of the Communist Party of Ireland, Menzies joined the Revolutionary Workers Groups in the early 1930s and was involved in the Outdoor Relief struggle. He was prominent as a leader of the squatters' movement in Northern Ireland after the war.

An enthusiastic supporter of the Daily Worker, he delivered 100 copies a day by carrier bicycle to the Shorts aircraft factory in Belfast from the small newsagents' shop he set up with compensation money from a factory accident.

His daughter, Edwina, one of five daughters he and his wife Sadie Newell, from Newtownards, had married Jimmy Stewart, General Secretary for a long time of the Communist Party of Ireland. Menzies died aged 82 in 1993.
