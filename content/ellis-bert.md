Bert Ellis

Ellis was the Communist Party’s candidate in the 1950 local elections for Child’s Hill ward on what was then Hendon council.

This is now the southern-most ward of the London borough of Barnet.

In the 1950 parliamentary election, Majorie Pollitt had stood for the Communist Party in North Hendon.

Majorie had taken 2% of the vote.   Ellis is pictured below.
