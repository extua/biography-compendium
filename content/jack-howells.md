Jack Howells

Born in South Wales, Jack Howells worked in London as a toolmaker during the 1930s and 1940s.

Active in his union as well as the Communist Party, he was one of a group of Party members who built up a network of factory branches in north-west London.

He was at Cable Street and was involved in the Aid to Spain Movement and the campaigns to lift the ban on the Daily Worker in 1940-1 and to open the Second Front during the war.

Howells moved back to Wales in the 1950s and died in 1995.
