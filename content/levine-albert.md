Albert Levine

Of an eastern European background, Levine was born in the East End of London. Having joined the Communist Party, he was active in the defence of Cable Street against Oswald Mosley's fascists.

After the Second World War broke out, he joined the RAF, and his facility with languages, especially German, placed him in intelligence. His most notable service was with the unit known as "Popski's private army", which operated behind enemy lines in the North African desert and Italy.

He became a teacher after the war and was a talented amateur violinist. From 1961, was an English literature teacher at the Working Men's College in Camden Town, north London and was later made head of English at Copland community school in Brent. He died aged 89.
