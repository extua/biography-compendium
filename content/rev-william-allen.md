Reverend William Allen

 

The Reverend William E Allen was, for twelve years, the congregational minister at Dulwich Grove Congregational Church, Dulwich, London, SE22.  

After an article by him in his parish magazine, urging nationalisation of “the holiday business”, was leaked to the Daily Mirror, parishioners began agitating against him. Although a formal statement from the parish emphasised that he was popular, he felt himself obliged was to resign his position as minister because his Communist Party membership had divided parishioners.
