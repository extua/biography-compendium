Stewart Gilmour

Stewart Gilmour was a Communist Party member from the small paper-making village of Leslie in Fife, Scotland.

He was re-elected to the council in April 1961, having being previously been a Communist councillor for Leslie between 1955-1958.

Leslie is at the northern end of the River of Leven in the eastern part of Fife which was marked for the dominance of the Communist Party in local politics in the half century period from the early 1920s.
