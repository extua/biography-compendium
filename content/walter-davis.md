A member of the Young Communist League's National Committee, or executive, in the 1940s and early 1950s, Walter Davies was the holder of the Distinguished Service Cross.

It may be that he was engaged in the legal profession in the post war period, for the report of the 1950 Party National Congress records not only that he was a delegate to that congress, held on May 20th-21st in the Beaver Hall, London, but that Davis "carried the fight for Peace into the courtroom as fearlessly as he once piloted his plane in the war against fascism".
