Jim Gibb

Both Jim Gibb and his wife come from families with strong trade union and Communist Party connections.

Jim’s father-in-law was John Foster, the long-term Communist AEU National Organiser (see separate entry). John’s daughter – and Jim’s wife - was for a long time a member of NATFE and a branch officer at NESCOT at Epsom.  
  
Jim himself was for a long time both a YCL and Communist Party member.

He was a member of the AEU, in both Kingston and London North Districts of the union, and the appropriate Party branches.

Due to job changes, he left the AEU and joined ASTMS and eventually the AUT and is now retired.
