Born in 1947 in Newcastle, the son of a postman, Wardman read English at Oxford. He became a full-time worker for the Communist Party in West Yorkshire for five years.

He worked as a Probation Officer in Kent and Yorkshire and was a social worker living in Harlow when he published his first novel, \`Crispin’s Spur’ in 1985. (He is pictured here from around that time.)

His second, \`Reparation’ was published in 1987 both are highly political visions of the future, serious attempts at a readable version of the Marxist novel.  ![](http://79.170.40.183/grahamstevenson.me.uk/images/stories/wardman%20gordon%20RESIZED.jpg)
