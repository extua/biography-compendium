Born in 1906, Bedow was a Unity Theatre activist from Paul Robeson’s appearance at Mornington Crescent in \`Plant in the Sun’. An activist in the Co-op movement, he was also involved in the folk song scene. He was a close colleague of Alfie Bass (pictured next to Robeson) Lionel Bart and Bill Owen. A concert was held to celebrate his sixty years in the Unity movement. He died in 1997.
