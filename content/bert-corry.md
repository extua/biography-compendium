Bert Corry

The Secretary of Salford Young Communist League, a bricklayer by trade, he volunteered for the Merchant Navy in World War Two. Sadly, like so many merchant seamen at this time, his very first trip out proved to be his last. He died in  January 1942 whilst serving on board the Empire Surf, sunk by U-boat about 600 miles east of the Orkney Isles.  47 crew were lost from a total crew 53.
