Maurice Campbell Cornforth

Born in 1909, Cornforth is principally remembered as philosopher. Initially, he was a follower of Wittgenstein but joined the Communist Party in the 1930s and produced many works in the Marxist tradition. 

He was active in the local Communist Party branch helping in the fight against unemployment. ![](https://grahamstevenson.me.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/8B6A6E52-830B-475E-889F-8A5F2B45F8AB-257x300.jpeg)He was full-time party secretary in East Anglia in the 1930s, then director of Lawrence and Wishart.
