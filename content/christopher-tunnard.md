Christopher Tunnard

Arthur Coney Tunnard was born in Victoria, British Columbia on 7 July 1910 but went by the name of Christopher throughout life. He is believed to have been a member of the Communist Party when living at 'Aldbury' Chertsey, in the period up to 1935, then in London and at St Ann's Hill Surrey, and back to London again before moving to the USA in 1939.

There, Tunnard became well-known as a modernist landscape architect and town planner. The author of \`Gardens and the Modern Landscape'(1938), he taught at Harvard and then Yale, where he became a professor in town planning, writing numerous publications. He died in 1979.
