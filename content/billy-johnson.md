Billy Johnson

Johnson moved to Yorkshire in the 1920s and was for 54 years a working miner.

He was also a life-long member of the Communist Party, along with his wife, Martha.

Billy's brother, Jack, was an outstanding orator during the 1926 general strike and miners' lock-out in the Castleford area.

The family of five brothers were all victimised for a long period following the struggle.
