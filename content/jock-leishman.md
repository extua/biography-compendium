Jock Leishman

Born in 1904, Leishman was by origin a Scottish Communist but lived for much of his later life in Birmingham.

He was one of the legendary breed of Communists in the 1930s, which kept the Daily Worker in circulation by collecting the papers at railway stations in the early morning on a bicycle and ferrying them to newsagents or direct to subscribers' homes.

A Co-op activist, married to Chris Leishman an USDAW union activist, Jock was a long term pensioners' movement campaigner and died in 1995.
