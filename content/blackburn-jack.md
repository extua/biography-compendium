Jack Blackburn

The branch secretary of the local Communist Party branch in the late 1940s, Blackburn had been secretary for some time, despite the fact that he held the responsible post of District Architect for Rowley Regis Urban District Council, a Midlands council near to Birmingham.

He was involved in an incident that arose during the period of the Phony War, 1939-41 (described in more detail under Jim Westwood’s biographical sketch). There were six Communist Party members who worked for the local council in various job roles. A copy of the Daily Worker was found on council premises and all the Party members lost their jobs.

Jack Blackburn failed his medical to join the Forces and he was accepted back in his job while awaiting application to design a Naval base at Trinacomalee in what was then colonial Ceylon (today Shri Lanka).
