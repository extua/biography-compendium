Sheila Schaffer

Schaffer died aged 82 in 2010 after 30-odd years of political life in the Labour Party in Brighton over three decades, including being a councillor and mayor. In her later years she was an OAP campaigner.

As a teenager, she joined the Young Communist League during the Second World War. But she was also a member of Habonim, an organisation for young Zionists, although in later years her admiration for Israel began to wane as she saw the reality of the occupation suffered by the Palestinians.

She became a student at the London School of Economics and had a career as a senior university librarian.

Sheila was one of those who left the Communist Party after the events in Hungary in 1956.
