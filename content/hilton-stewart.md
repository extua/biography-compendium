Hilton Stewart

Originally a joiner, Hilton became a full time District Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers. On the creation of the unified building workers union, UCATT, he became the regional organiser for the Barnsley and Sheffield District and was a Communist Party member all his adult life.

Although officially retiring in 1977, Hilton maintained activity as a delegate to Barnsley Trade Union Council and was a member of its executive committee until 1995. He was also a member of the executive committee of Wortley Hall.

He became well known to the local Barnsley public during the miners’ strike of 1984-5 for running the \`Appeals Caravan’ of Barnsley Trades Council, which was situated in Cheapside pedestrian precinct and collected donations and gifts for miners and their families. Hilton did not miss a single day throughout the strike in staffing the caravan. Hilton died aged 83 in 1996.
