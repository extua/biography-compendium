John Jack

John JackÂ moved to Tumble from Llanfyrnach to work in the pits, beginning as a labourer.

He was already much influenced politically by involvement in trade unionism when he was conscripted in World War I to join the military police.

He became a "free-thinker" but the experience of conditions in the pits and especially the effect of the General Strike in1926 saw him become a life-long Communist.
