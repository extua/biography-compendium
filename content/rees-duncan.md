Duncan Rees

Born in 1953, Rees was a member of the Communist Party’s Peace Advisory committee from 1975. Anational council member of CND, he was an activist in Cardiff and Liverpool.

Elected general secretary of CND for three years from 1976, he was eventually replaced by Bruce Kent.

In the late 1970s, he lived with Cathy Ashton, now a senior establishment political figure, when she worked for CND in an administrative capacity. When she was appointed to a senior EU position, this fact much exercised the right-wing press, which suddenly and \`mysteriously’ became aware of her earlier dalliance.  

From February 1980 to March 1981, Rees worked for the Morning Star, returning to CND as national organiser from 1981 to 1985. However, he left the Party in 1983 and worked for Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign in the late ‘80s.
