Evans was a Communist Party member and miner who worked for the Labour Research Department in the 1920s. It is believed that he came from Garnant, South Wales.

He accompanied miner’s leader Arthur Cook on his visit to Soviet Russiain 1926.

Evans reported that Cook was greatly impressed by the organisation of Soviet industry, stating: “I return encouraged for a great class war ... May the English Revolution come soon.”  
  
Evans recalled an episode of interest concerning Cook’s visit to Birminghamin November 1926:  
  
_“I remember we went to the Bull ring in_ _Birmingham__... just at the  beginning of November and he had been at it every weekend and during the week._ _When we went to_ _Birmingham__he was pretty low actually, his voice was hoarse and he was beginning to feel seriously the strain. and I had his notes ready and the chairman announced - the whole place was packed - the chairman announced A J Cook and he got up and said “Comrades” and you could feel his voice croaking you know, and you could hear the whole audience … “Oh, oh” .. And, after the meeting, I had to give him some whisky and a rub down and he was in a terrible state.”_
