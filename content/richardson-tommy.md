Â Tommy Richardson

  
Richardson was a well respected Communist councillor elected in the 1958 local elections for Houghton-le-spring, which joined Sunderland in 1974 but then had its own Urban District Council.

Then still a mining town, with a thousand miners, Communist councilors had been elected there on and off from at least as far back as 1936.
