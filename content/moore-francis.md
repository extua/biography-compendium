Francis Moore

Francis Moore was born in 1913. A Sheffield teacher and activist in the NUT, she was a life-long Communist Party member, having joined the Party in Sheffield on May Day 1935.

She was married to Bill Moore (see separate entry), with whom she had three children.  

Although her busy live left her with little time to write in her younger days, during the s to s she produced a substantial body of accomplished poetry, some of which was published. Francis was not motivated to seek a widespread audience for her work but was occasionally prevailed upon to read to audiences in meetings. 

She died in 1984 and her poems can be found at: [http://www.mancvoices.co.uk/](http://www.mancvoices.co.uk/)
