Les Kingscott

The Chairman of a Joint Shop Stewards Committee at a Birmingham motor factory joined the Communist Party in March 1961. As he explained in the Daily Worker, "I joined after many, many months of careful thought, and hesitations".

Kingscott was one of a record number of people joining the Communist Party in the Midlands at this juncture. Don Brayford, the District Organiser (see separate entry) stated, this was the highest level of recruitment â€œin the Midlands since the end of the War". The District recorded that its membership of 1,600 had been bolstered by 200 new members who had joined in just six months and "many recent recruits to the Communist Party have been leading engineering workers".
