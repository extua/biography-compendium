A skilled engineering worker, Welsh was the secretary of the Communist Party's workplace branch at London Transport's Lillie Bridge engineering depot in the early to mid 1970s.

He was lauded in the Party press at one stage for winning three new recruits to the Party, two to the YCL and 12 new readers for the Morning Star at his workplace.
