Wynn was the Communist president of Derby’s Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU) in the mid-1950.

He was for a very long time, until retirement in the 1970s, the convenor of Derby’s Rolls Royce factories.

Archie is pictured on a 1984 demonstration in Derby of soldarity with the miners.
