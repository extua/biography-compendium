A long-time AEU stalwart and Communist in Sheffield, Chris Law took part in his first strike in 1932 at the age of 16 years, when the Sheffield Star newspaper cut its commission to delivery boys. He later became an engineering worker and organised the Sheffield No 9 branch, which became known to all and sundry as \`the red branch', since it refused to operate a TUC ban on Communists holding office, especially in delegations to local trades councils (TUCs).

Chris Law was once thrown out of Sheffield town hall for protesting at the speech by the American ambassador during the trial of 12 US Communists in the late 1940s.
