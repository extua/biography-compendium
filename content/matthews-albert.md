Albert Matthews

A Rochdale Communist who had a pamphlet about him written by Mick Jenkins (see separate entry).

He is possibly the Communist who stood in Wardlesworth West ward, Rochdale in November 1932 and secured a respectable 479 votes.

Other comrades of Matthews stood under the banner of the NUWM at this election, including Jones (389 votes) in Wuerdle Ward and Riley (152) in Spolland East, Rochdale.
