Robin Mudie

He was known as Robin, but born Robert David Mudie on May 17, 1922 to Angelici (nee Falcioni) and Robert Wright Mudie, a jute mill manager in Bengal.  Robin's aunt also lived in Bengal, as a nun, Mother Germain. 

Robin joined the army at 17, lying about his age to be with his friend, from whom he was almost immediately separated. He served with Royal Artillery Corps and rose to become a Captain.

He was posted to India during war, and Singapore afterwards. It is probable that he joined the Communist Party around the time of the battle of Stalingrad.

During the post-war era he was a journalist and writer, who lived on Erskine Hill, in Hampstead Garden Suburb, and enjoyed cricket. The local branch of the Party was then very active, though he probably allowed his membership to lapse following the Khrushchev revelations about Stalin. 

Robin Mudie died December 23, 1993.
