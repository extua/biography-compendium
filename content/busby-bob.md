Busby was President of the Middleton trades council and its delegate to the Lancashire Federation of Trades Councils.

Middleton is now within the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, in Greater Manchester and to the north of the conurbation, but it was a distinct and separate entity at the time in the early and mid-20th century. Â 

The chair of his local branch of the AEU, Busby was also a Communist candidate for Birch ward in the Borough of Middleton during the 1960s.

In 1965, he obtained 18% of the Labour vote, considered to be a reasonable margin for a Party member.
