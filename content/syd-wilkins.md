Syd Wilkins

Born on 1st October 1908, Syd began work pit age 14. Only a matter of weeks after he started, he was the first to find, underground, the body of a fellow boy run over by a tub. Sent pony driving, he was allocated a pony that was not only wild - it was mad. Fortunately, it ended up killing itself and not Syd!

But both experiences were a start of a life-long concern for health and safety at work for working people for this stalwart Communist.

A delegate to his local Trades Council for over 40 years, he was an activist of the Rotherham Pensioners' Group and died on 15th December 1989.
