Rosemary Small

Elsa Rosemary Small was born in 1927 and wrote for the Daily Worker and Morning Star.  A frequent series was on "colour prejudice” in Britain in 1965.

She introduced a major report on women at the 32nd National Congress of the Communist Party in 1971.  Based in Kent, working out of the Party's central offices, she was the Communist Party’s full-time women’s organiser for a period in the early 1970s and edited the Party's women's journal, Link.  

Rosemary Small was the author of the Party pamphlets “Women: the road to equality and socialism” (1972) and “Marxism and the Family” (1974).

She married Neil Reid and died in 1981.
