Norma Bramley

Norma was a Nottingham Young Communist League activist in the early 1960s. She took part in the Youth March against German bases in 1961 that went from formerly heavily bombed Coventry to the Pemborkeshire army base at Castlemartin, which specialised in tank movements and where the Bundeswehr were mainly operating from.

This is possibly the Norma Bramley, “a politically active teacher” who married Ken Gill (see separate entry) in 1997.

Bramley is the author of \`Author of Sisters in Solidarity, a history of the National Assembly of Women.
