Roland W Casosola

Casosola was a President of the Foundry Workers Union and an active fighter for the peace movement, who joined the Communist Party in 1961. On doing so, he declared:

"When I think back to the period of 1900-1939, I recall that the problems of my generation were the First World War and mass unemployment. Then came the Second World War and, as we enter the Atomic age, the new generation faces problems that are grave and heavy. That is why I joined the Peace Movement - because I am of the opinion that the question of peace today transcends all other problems and I am well aware that there are many, without peace none of them will be solved.‚Äù
