Lou Armour

Born in Liverpool, Armour joined the Communist Party from an early age.

A skilled painter by trade, he became a full time official of the Association of Painters and Decorators in 1966 and remained so beyond the amalgamation that created UCATT.Â 

He played a leading role in the national building strike of 1972.

Armour retired to Runcorn in 1984 but remained very active politically, especially in the peace movement; he died at the age of 69 in 1990 and was a member of the Communist Party of Britain in his last years.
