George Wake

Born in around 1923, Wake joined the Communist Party in 1951 after having been expelled from the Labour Party.

He was secretary of the Communist Party’s Barking branch and a member of South Essex district committee for many years.

He was a candidate for the Party at Dagenham, amongst other contests, for the 1966 general election. 

A fitter for the Central Electricity Generating Board, Wake was also a shop steward and union activist, for a long time the secretary of the Liaison Committee for the Defence of Trade Unions. 

Employed at Barking Power Station, he was an AEU Branch Secretary, Convenor and a member of the Editorial Committee of "Power Worker".

He was a candidate for municipal elections for the Communist Party several times.

In much later years, he was associated with the disputed leadership of Mike Hicks in the CPB.
