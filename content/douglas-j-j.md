J J Douglas

Douglas was the Communist Party’s candidate for Morpeth, Northumberland, in November 1932.

He was the only candidate in his election address to mention the then new "Means Test" unemployment Benefit.

Yet some 600 unemployed in Morpeth were on Means Test and many had been debarred from claiming.

Douglas was one of 150 Communist candidates standing in local elections in 1932
