J F Horrabin

Born in 1884, by the time he joined the Communist Party at its foundation, Horrabin was settled in his career as a writer and cartoonist.

He left the Party within only a few years, in common with a number of early enthusiasts, to cast his lot in more decisively with the Labour Party, as proscriptions against Communists toughened.

In the 1930s, he was a supporter of socialist unity through the Socialist League.

During his time as a Communist Party member, Horrabin was a frequent contributor of hand-drawn maps to the Party’s journal, \`The Communist’.   He died in 1962.
