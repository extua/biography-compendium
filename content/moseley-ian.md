Ian Moseley

Mosley was born on 8th October 1936. He was an active member of the Communist Party in the Black Country, in the West Midlands, but left in 1977 to join the “New Communist Party” breakaway, attracting some to follow, at least for a period.

He was active in supporting the miners, CND and British Soviet Friendship Society in the subsequent period and died on 17th January 2006.
