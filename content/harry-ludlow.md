Harry Ludlow

Ludlow worked 20 years for the Lincoln Corporation Electricity Department.

He was elected the Electrical Trade Union's shop steward in 1930 and became the Secretary of Lincoln District Engineering Shop Stewards' Federation and also was, during the war, the Secretary of a Joint Production Committee.

On 24th October 1946, he was sacked from his job at Ruston & Hornsby Boiler Works for his trade union and Communist Party activities.

He was especially active on local housing issues and was the Communist Party candidate for Park Ward, Lincoln in 1946. He fought on the issue of housing, stating with the force that obviously made him a marked man: "My job took me into every house in the city rich and poor, so when I compiled a list of houses which could and should be requisitioned, I could speak with inside knowledge."
