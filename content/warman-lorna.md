Â Lorna Warman

Lorna was born in 1917 and was a life-long Communist. She was wife to both George T Bridges and then Bill Warman, both leading Communists in their day (see separate entries for both).

In first Wembley and then Coventry, and finally in north Yorkshire, Lorna gave spirited support to maintaining Marxism as a guiding force and was a member of the Communist Party of Britain to the end.

She died on May 11th 2011 aged 93.
