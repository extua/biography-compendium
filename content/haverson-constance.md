Constance Haverson

Probably born Gladys Constance Haverson in 1899, she was a granddaughter of the then future Labour Party leader, George Lansbury.

A member of the British Communist Party, she studied at the International Lenin School, Moscow, in 1937 using the political pseudonym of Irene Anderson.

Allegedly a courier for the Comintern, by 1936, she appears to have divorced Harry Lansbury Haverson, who may have been a cousin.
