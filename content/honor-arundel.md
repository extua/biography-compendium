Honor Arundel

Children’s writer and Daily Worker film critic, Honor Arundel, along with Geoffrey Trease, are probably two of the best known Communist children’s authors.

Honor (Morfydd) Arundel was born in North Wales in 15th October 1919. She had a passion for poetry and writing, as did many members of the Communist Party. For, as Randall Swingler the Daily Worker literary editor (1939-1941), stated, “Poetry is the most intense … form of communication between man”.

As a result of her interest she became heavily involved in the development of the Left Book Club’s Poets Group, established in late 1937; its London group meet at Honor Arundel’s flat in BelsizePark.

By March 1939 there were over 20 Left Book Club Poetry groups outside London which included Manchester (Secretary Ray Watkinson), Cambridge (George Scurfield) and Hastings (F C Ball).

Under the initiative of the Communist Party, The Left Book Club Poetry Group was re established in July 1938. The group produced a duplicated monthly newsletter, entitled “Poetry and the people”. Its first editors being John Ongley, John Isserlis and John Manifold. “Poetry and the people” was an attempt by the Communist Party to build on the relative success of “Left Review” which had built up sales to about 5,000 but had little broad appeal beyond the Party by “bringing the poet and the people into as close a contact as possible for their mutual understanding and enjoyment”. It is clear that not all in the Party felt that Swingler, Arundel and the other Communist Poets were necessarily spending their time productively. Maurice Cornforth, in the Daily Worker, wrote that there was “no point in treating communist poets as tender shoots which wilt at the first wind of critical comments from the working class”.

With the collapse of the Left Book Club at the beginning of WWII, Swingler and other Communist writers took the decision to establish a new “more professional” publication “Our Time”,.which would include architecture, medicine, education, art and literature. The first edition of which appeared in Febuary 1941 and incorporated “Poetry and the people”. The editors were Swingler, James Boswell and Allen Hutt. the administrator was Charles Ringrose (see entries for all but Boswell), but when Ringrose was called up to national service he was replaced by Honor Arundel.

By 1943 Honor Arundel and Peter Phillips had become editors of “Our Time”, with a new format introduced in August 1943. Initially, sales hit the 5,000 mark, the maximum possible due to paper shortage and war time distribution restrictions. But the Forces clamour for cultural magazines, especially amongst ENSA, was such that by the end of the war it was selling 18,000 copies. With the end of the war and falling sales and political retrenchment Our Time” folded in August 1949, Swingler blaming Emile Burns, the Chair of Communist Party’s National

Cultural Committee for its demise.

Arundel married the Scottish Communist actor and Scottish Equity founder Alex McCridle (1911-1990), who played Jock in the popular radio programme Dick Barton, Special Agent (1946-1951), went on to become a regular television character actor and later appeared in the first \`Star Wars’ film in 1977 as General Jan Dodonna, leader of the Rebel Alliance.

Their house became a hub of Communist Party activity and organisation. Doris Lessing notes in her autobiography, “In a garden on the canal known as Little Venice, now very smart, then dingy and run down, there were held ceilidhs, where Ewan MacColl sang \[...\]. The house belong to Honor Tracy (sic) \[Arundel\], an upper-class young woman whose education had destined her for a very different life, and her husband Alex McCrindle ... who was in a radio series of immense popularity. There were people from the worlds of radio, music, and nascent television, and of course, women with children. Most of them were communists, but none of them were communists ten years later, except for Alex. And Ewan MacColl, the communist troubadour and bard.”

Arundel, as with so many writers who were members of the Communist Party was concerned about rural issues and as such was a regular contributor to the \`Country Standard’, as well as being involved in the National Agricultural Workers Union. She was the Communist Party candidate in 1958 for the West Sterlingshire, Scotland, constituency.

As the Daily Worker’s film critic in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Arundel had In June 1949 attended the International Film Festival at Marianske Lazne, Czechoslovakia in June 1949. There, she met photographer and filmmaker, Paul Strand, who attended to present his film \`NativeLand’. A life time friendship developed and, she accompanied on a visit to Uist prior to the making of his acclaimed photography study on Tir a'Mhurain /Outer Hebrides (1962) about life on the Scottish islands.

Arundel’s children’s books, many of which were set in Scotland and a number which became considerably popular, included: \`Emma's island’, \`Emma in Love’, \`The Longest Weekend’, \`The blanket word’, \`A Family Failing’, \`Girl in the Opposite Bed’, \`The amazing Mr. Prothero’ and \`Terrible Temptation’.

Arundel also wrote:

Honor Arundel died on 8th June 1973.
