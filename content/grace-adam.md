Dr Grace Adam

Born in 1898 in Scotland, Grace Adam was for many years a member of the Communist Party, probably from the 1930s.

She lived at various addresses over the years in Hertford Road, Enfield, and was an Assistant Medical Health Officer for Enfield Borough Council for many years.

Both before and after the Second World War, the Adams home was used by refugees. Grace Adam died in 1991.
