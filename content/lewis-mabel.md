Mabel Lewis

Mabel Lewis was a 1950s Communist County Councillor for Glamorgan County Council in the seat at Mountain Ash, long a Communist strong-hold in Wales.

Mabel was first elected in the 1930s; at the outbreak of the Second World War, she was active in the national Peoples Convention.

She stood for re-election in April 1961, securing 1,207 votes but narrowly failing to hold on to her seat. Just two months later she was re-elected in a by election held in June 1961, securing 1,263 votes beating Labour's William Morgan polled 956.

This victory gave the Communist Party two seats on the Glamorgan County Council, the other being Trevor Williams in Aberdare
