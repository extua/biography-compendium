Kay Loosen

An activist in the Clerks Union \[later APEX\], she became involved in its political work and also worked in the London Trades Council offices with Julius (Julie) Jacobs. Kay Loosen then worked for many years in the King Street offices of the Party. She started in the Education Department and then moved to the Organisation Department, working under Betty Lewis.

In later years, failing sight confined her to more local issues in the Muswell Hill area where she lived.

She was a member of a Communist Party of Britain branch until her death in August 1997.
