                <p>The tasks ... of the Young Communist Leagues ... might be summed up in a single word: learn ... the
                    youth in general, who want to advance to Communism, should learn Communism.</p>
                <p>It is the task of the Youth League to organise its practical activities in such a way that, by
                    learning,
                    organising, uniting and fighting, its members shall train both themselves and all those who look to

                Young people who come into contact with us, and they are many, choose not to join us partly because we
                don't have our house in order yet and partly because of the minority of "revolutionary Marxists" who
                rant on endlessly about the glories of the Soviet Union or the Bulgarian wheat harvest at YCL meetings,
                rather than grapple with the dilemma that feminism, lesbian and gay liberation and the black community
                pose to the established structures, theories and practices of the YCL. The YCL must change if it is to
                continue in existence.
