    <h1>World Youth Festivals</h1>
    <p>
      The most significant role of
      <abbr title="World Federation of Democratic ?Youth">WFDY</abbr> was to
      organise the massive cultural and political festivals held periodically in
      differing parts of the world. There have been 12 Festivals:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Prague (1947)</li>
      <li>Budapest (1949)</li>
      <li>Berlin (1951)</li>
      <li>Bucharest (1953)</li>
      <li>Warsaw (1955)</li>
      <li>Moscow (1957)</li>
      <li>Vienna (1959)</li>
      <li>Helsinki (1962)</li>
      <li>Sofia (1968)</li>
      <li>Berlin (1973)</li>
      <li>Cuba (1978)</li>
      <li>Moscow (1983)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      A festival usually had around sixteen thousand participants at it,
      although the 1973 Berlin Festival touched 26,000. From the original 63
      founding countries of
      <abbr title="World Federation of Democratic Youth">WFDY</abbr>, it had
      affiliates from 72 countries at its first festival and 112 by the 1959
      Vienna event. These festivals aimed to involve youth organisations other
      than of the Communists and were moreover always spectacular in character -
      a memorable event in each generation's experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some 14 organisations were involved in the Sofia 1968 British Preparatory
      Committee, the link up with the Vietnam campaign making this possible.
      Organisations like the Young Liberals, Young Oxfam and the Student
      Christian Movement joined up with the YCL in sending some 300 delegates to
      Bulgaria. The League saw this as an especially important development for
      its work in Britain. So much so that it approached the 1973 Berlin
      Festival with great plans for massive broad youth unity in the British
      Preparatory Committee, one thousand delegates were aimed for. Already, the
      previous year, a Vietnam Youth Committee had been set up under the
      auspices of the British Campaign for Peace in Vietnam. This brought
      together the National Union of Students (NUS), the Young Liberals, the
      Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (Technical and Supervisory
      Staffs) (AUEW/TASS), the United Nations Youth and Students Association and
      of course the YCL. All of these organisations and others were easily won
      to involvement in the World Youth Festival, the
      <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr> being a particularly
      important body. The
      <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr> had supported the 1947
      Youth Festival, but had not done so since due to governmental and other
      pressures associated with the cold war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from some tensions within the British delegation arising out of the
      presence of a Gay Liberation banner, the whole event did much to break
      down barriers artificially erected by the cold war. (The banner had been
      rather frowned upon by the East Germans, but supported vigorously on a
      point of principle by both the Young Liberals and the YCL national
      leadership, perhaps with tactical considerations back home being very much
      in the collective mind of the latter.) Major changes in the official youth
      movement in Britain were on their way. Together with the positive gains of
      the Berlin Festival, these laid the basis for even more significant unity.
      The main resolution at the YCL's 29th Congress in 1973 saw
      <q
        >the preparations (as) an example of the broad youth unity, albeit
        embryonic</q
      >
      that it sought generally in Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of tremendous significance for the next World Youth Festival after Berlin
      was the disaffiliation of the British Youth Council (BYC) from
      <abbr title="World Federation of Democratic Youth">WFDY</abbr>'s cold war
      rival, the World Assembly of Youth (WAY). This was to open up the
      possibility of much wider involvement in youth unity activities. It had
      become public knowledge that
      <abbr title="World Assembly of Youth">WAY</abbr> had been at least
      partially funded by the CIA for much of its life and the
      <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr>'s links with that body grew
      more and more tenuous. The
      <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr> itself had been set up in
      1949 and it was funded by various British government departments, as well
      as by the subscriptions of the affiliated organisations. These included
      such groups as the Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Boys’ Brigades, Young Farmers,
      Young Conservatives and a variety of Christian youth organisations, as
      well as the Labour Party Young Socialists and the Young Liberals. In 1976,
      with the link with <abbr title="World Assembly of Youth">WAY</abbr> now
      dissolved, the YCL and other progressive organisations like the
      Co-operative movement's Woodcraft Folk, the
      <abbr title="National Union of School Students">NUSS</abbr> and the
      National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS) all decided to affiliate
      to the <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr>. At his first
      attempt, Tom Bell narrowly failed to obtain election to the executive
      committee of the <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparations for the 11th World Youth Festival, to be held from Friday
      28th July to Saturday 5th August, were already underway and it was clear
      that, especially with it being held in Cuba, that there would have to be a
      tremendous effort to avoid the massive organisational and travelling
      difficulties. Indeed the Festival was put back a year to allow for all of
      this. 23,000 delegates - 18,500 from outside Cuba - from 145 countries
      were expected, along with 1,000 journalists. There were 3,200 from West
      Europe, 800 from Africa, 3,800 from the Americas, 1,600 from Asia, 800
      from the Middle East, 1,000 from the Soviet Union, 750 from the East
      Germany and 3,050 from East Europe. After an initial expectation of a
      higher number, it eventually became clear that the British delegation
      would only number 180 and it would cost £310 to send each one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr> agreed to participate
      in the Festival on the understanding that the British Preparatory
      Committee would support the right of its individual member groups to raise
      whatever issues they wished and that the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> itself raise
      certain issues of controversy with respect to democracy in socialist
      states. The <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr> was under great
      pressure before the event from the Federation of Conservative Students and
      the Young Conservatives to withdraw its support, indeed these groups
      themselves refused to participate. Even so, several Tories remained on the
      delegation as representatives of the Churches, in particular in the
      Methodist camp. While the Foreign Office refused to give a £5,000 grant
      for a cultural delegation from Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr> was to play a
      particularly important part in this
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>. Charles Clarke,
      who had recently been the National President of the
      <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr>, landed the job of
      permanent British representative in Havana for a year before the Festival.
      While the leader of the delegation was Trevor Phillips, 24 year old
      <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr> President. His deputy
      was Peter Mandelson, noted then only for being personally related to the
      former Labour Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison and tipped, like Phillips,
      to go on to greater things. (Mandelson had been a member of the London YCL
      for about nine months in the early 1970s.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For both of these the whole affair was an important test. As the Sunday
      Telegraph, rather bluntly put it,
      <q
        >both plan careers in mainstream politics, and Mr Mandelson felt that a
        heavily Stalinist British contribution in Havana could have serious
        career repercussions for him. Messrs Phillips and Mandelson, therefore,
        were determined that Britain would raise the issue of human rights.</q
      >
      \[Sunday Telegraph August 6th 1978\] In particular, they planned that
      leaflets on the status of Soviet dissidents, Shcharansky and Orlov, should
      be distributed at the Festival. Mandelson, of course, notoriously became
      Labour's key media man under the Kinnock leadership; Clarke was the key
      figure in Kinnock's personal political advisory team. Phillips went on to
      become a TV producer and occasional presenter. All three ended up as key
      figures in the Blair project.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a heavy-handed move of supremely unconscious irony, the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> leadership decided
      to rid itself of any delegates who would be too obviously opposed to the
      plan to seek publicity for an anti-Soviet position. What involvement there
      was on the part of the YCL in the original calculations remains undefined,
      but how else could the non-communist leadership of the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> be aware of
      identity of the most outspoken Communists hoping to be part of the
      delegation? Who told Phillips and Mandelson which were the key people to
      exclude? Whatever the position, seven CPGB and NCP members were literally
      banned from going to Cuba. Trevor Phillips, as Chair of the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>, and Tom Bell, as
      its Secretary, wrote to at least three of these who then made the whole
      affair public. They were Dave Smith (<abbr title="Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs">ASTMS</abbr>), Will Gee (<abbr title="Fire Brigades Union">FBU</abbr>) and Lysandras
      Lysandrou (United Cypriot Youth Organisation - EKON).
    </p>
    <p>
      They were told that there were travel difficulties and that as they were
      nominated by organisations not in membership of the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> and that the
      <q
        >trade union section of the delegation is already fairly heavily
        subscribed to</q
      >
      it was not possible to accept their nomination. More decisively, and the
      strongest clue to where the objections were coming from,
      <q
        >it has been questioned by a member organisation of the
        <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> whether your
        approach to the Festival, given the basis of your past political record
        and activity would be entirely in line with the tenets and spirit of
        British participation in the Festival, as agreed and delineated by the
        British Preparatory Committee.</q
      >
      \[Letter dated 14th July 1978\] Which "member organisation" was not
      publicly revealed, but clearly non-communists could only be aware of what
      was essentially a criticism of their differences with the YCL's line on
      socialist democracy from the YCL leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving the Phillips-Bell letter, two of the excluded met with the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>'s organising
      committee and offered to travel by other means, if travelling was the
      problem. The committee voted by 3 to 1 not to reverse their exclusion -
      leaving the matter of their political suitability as the key objection. A
      simple reference to the balance of the delegation reveals a high
      proportion of students and a rather small trade union delegation.

      Given that travelling was not really the problem, although there were
      difficulties these were not insurmountable, and that if any group needed
      thinning down it was the student element of the delegation, how could the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>'s banning of the
      dissident element be justified? The community sector could not lend itself
      to reduction, as there were generally only one or two delegates per group.
      If the <abbr title="Transport and General Workers' Union">TGWU</abbr> with
      two million members could be easily represented by 5 delegates, how could
      it be that the <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr> with
      perhaps half or a third of that number needed 38 delegates? In truth,
      delegates were often simply people who had both the interest and the money
      to pay. Their sponsoring organisation had simply endorsed them as
      delegates, at no cost to the organisation. Apart from measures to ensure
      that each single organisation was at least once represented, very little
      tinkering with the overall delegation was really necessary. Therefore,
      there could only seriously remain the matter of the political objection.
      Two of the excluded delegates produced statements, revealing the full
      details of the affair, including copies of the correspondence. They
      declared that the <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr> had given
      an ultimatum to the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> to veto the likes
      of them and that they had been removed for political reasons
      <q>without any opportunity to reply to the allegations.</q> In the
      <cite>Morning Star</cite>, Reuben Falber for the CPGB was pressed by their
      statement to publicly respond for the Party that it understood travel
      problems. But that it was regrettable that, in making the difficult
      decisions to thin down the delegation, it was implied that some were
      excluded because of their politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Lentell, speaking for the YCL as its National Organiser, made a
      similar point as Falber over the travel arrangements question. But the YCL
      had disagreements on some parts of the festival preparations and felt that
      the <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>, having laid
      down its political principles at an early stage, had the right to ensure
      <q>that the British delegation adhered to these principles.</q> Implicit
      in this was some degree of sympathy for the exclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Bell, in a subsequent article on the Festival in Challenge, conceded
      that the <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>
      <q>didn't handle every question as well as it might have done</q>, but
      thought on balance the Festival overall was a positive development. While
      the exclusion of some people was not <q>handled in the best way</q> and
      some should have gone, Bell supported the right of the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> to make the
      decision. \[Challenge No 55 1978\]
    </p>
    <p>
      For the vast majority of delegates the first they knew of the controversy
      was when they arrived in Cuba. The statements of the excluded two,
      together with the copies of correspondence were distributed in large
      numbers by their sympathisers amongst the delegation. After protracted
      arguments a delegation meeting at the large, modern teacher training
      college six kilometres from Havana, which the British shared with the
      Irish, Scandinavian and Low Countries delegations, passed a decisive
      resolution to bring over three individuals excluded from the delegation.
      Clive Haswell of the Welsh Preparatory Committee - two of the excluded
      were Welsh - moved that the steering committee running affairs in Cuba
      amongst the delegation be instructed to reverse the ban and make
      arrangements to get the three to the Festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been necessary to propose a procedural motion to discuss the
      matter, despite an attempt by the steering committee to avoid this. Then
      the motion was narrowly passed. Once the issues were debated the
      delegation voted 84 for the critical motion 50 against. It should be noted
      that 73 of the delegation were either absent or abstained. The decision
      was of course largely symbolic, the meeting being held on the first day of
      the Festival at 1pm on Friday 28th August, but it was symptomatic of a
      large gap between the steering committee and the delegation majority. The
      three never got to the Festival of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      This affair rather conditioned the atmosphere on the delegation and
      attitudes to the leadership of the steering committee, in particular the
      determination of Mandelson and Phillips to issue a delegation statement on
      human rights. A document, which bore all the hallmarks of a rushed and
      thoughtless composition, especially in the circumstances that the
      delegation now found itself, suddenly appeared. Very little consultation
      with very few people had prefaced its appearance, which drew much
      criticism. It was ill conceived and almost calculated to annoy most
      Communists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell, in his subsequent Challenge article, conceded that
      <q
        >while some delegates wanted more time to discuss the contents of the
        statement, a minority were determined to prevent it being issued at all
        … given the sectarian, Stalinist positions they held they were not
        prepared to accept any criticisms of the Soviet Union or other socialist
        countries.</q
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday Telegraph reckoned that about half of the delegation –
      something like 80 odd people – were Communists, and their views varied.
      Many supported the CPGB’s position on socialist democracy, but were
      unhappy with the ease with which some allowed unbalanced positions to be
      postulated by the delegation leadership. Many, perhaps 30 to 40, were
      committed to one or another of the tendencies inside the British Communist
      movement, which repudiated the official position on these matters. An
      alliance between the two elements, winning support amongst the trade union
      and some Labour and progressive groupings, ensured that the delegation was
      deeply split.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some, especially those associated with anti-imperialist causes like
      Ireland, were strongly opposed even to the notion of carrying the Union
      Flag ahead of the British delegation's representatives on the opening
      ceremony's 'walk past'. While the discovery that the official, identifying
      T-shirts bore the Festival logo coloured in with the Union Flag created
      some controversy. Those who objected argued that the flag was associated
      in half of the world with bloody imperialism, a force which the Festival
      was specifically in opposition to. Those who favoured the Union Flag
      simply viewed it as the nation's official emblem, which was known to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all this, it is not surprising perhaps that the draft statement on
      human rights was greeted with hostility. Moreover, there was a time
      constraint that led to a feeling that the steering committee was trying to
      rush things. The
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> wanted the
      statement ready for a particular commission on the first Monday of the
      Festival. Despite an attempt to block the statement completely, the
      delegation voted to discuss the draft and to amend it by a vote of 64 to
      60. (Noticeably, as the controversy raged, fewer and fewer people
      participated in the delegation meetings.) 30 to 40 delegates then walked
      out to draft an alternative statement. The remainder, including many who
      differed with much of the intent, tone and content of the originating
      statement determined to change it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 6.00 p.m. on Sunday 30th to 4.00 am on Monday 31st, during
      successive, strained and marathon sessions at the delegation’s lodgings,
      the statement was hotly debated and amended. The initial session by 6.30
      p.m. had agreed on the go-ahead. Then the YCL EC members met with the
      CPNSC members – as no doubt did other caucuses – drafting amendments which
      were in the main agreed to by the delegation leadership and, subsequently,
      the majority of the delegation as a whole, in a midnight to four am
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original statement linked the Helsinki Declaration on Human Rights to
      détente, arguing that concern over human rights did not sabotage the fight
      for peace. Central to all this was the freedom of speech and assembly.
      Concern was expressed about the 1968 events in Czechoslovakia and the more
      recent experience of the Charter 77 group there. The case of Yuri Orlov in
      the USSR was raised and it was made clear that the British delegation
      would continue to campaign on these matters most firmly. All in all it was
      calculated and blunt - the intent being to clearly distance the British
      delegation from the socialist countries on issues of controversy in
      Western media. These participating nations would most certainly view the
      highly specific and selective statement as an intended insult in what was
      intended to be a Festival of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eventual amended version put these points a little more in context. A
      firm distinction between those who are "genuinely committed to both
      détente and human rights, and those who are exploiting the issue of human
      rights for their own political advantage" was made. Moreover, the absence
      of some fundamental human rights in Britain was noted, especially with
      regard to Northern Ireland. It was recognised that human rights also
      involved some fairly fundamental economic rights and the exploitation of
      developing countries by the advanced capitalist nations (not specified as
      such however) was a pre-requisite to human rights in that part of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypocrisy of the Western nations was thus signified in the revised
      statement. In particular, specific instances of abuses of human rights in
      the USA were mentioned, especially of black and indigenous American
      peoples. The original draft had called for the ending of racist political
      systems just in South Africa. This was implicitly widened to allow for the
      interpretation that this could apply to Britain also. The original had
      said that the delegation was opposed to particular imperialist
      interference from whatever quarter and this was softened to make it less
      an obviously contrived comment on the socialist as well as capitalist
      world. A positive note was also injected, linking anti-imperialist
      struggles throughout the world to the concrete solidarity organisations
      and actions traditionally associated with the British people. Criticisms
      of the USSR and South Africa had been made in the same breath, but were
      now separated and some positive features of Soviet life were incorporated,
      albeit that these were rather lamely highlighted. The previous
      condemnation of the Warsaw Pact intervention in 1968 in Czechoslovakia was
      turned into a statement of the fact that the intervention had been widely
      condemned in Britain. As was the criticism of the trial of Yuri Orlov,
      again, instead of the delegation being committed to condemn the USSR, it
      was observed that such criticisms had been made by some. While, finally,
      the previous commitment to campaigning on differences with the socialist
      world was eliminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minority produced their own statement, on behalf of "a large
      percentage of the British delegation" they dissociated themselves from the
      majority statement, which they identified as being issued by the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> - which it had not
      been, even in the first instance, let alone after amendment by the
      delegation. The minority statement complained that the majority statement
      did not "represent the views of the youth and students of Great Britain".
      Moreover that the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> since its inception
      had not taken the "wide ranging opinions of the British youth into
      account". The exclusions were referred to and it was stated that the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> had not "taken
      actions based on majority decisions either here (in Havana) or in Great
      Britain". The spirit of the Festival was endorsed by the statement, with
      the implication that a minority of the delegation, especially in
      leadership positions, had other axes to grind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that this was the end of such controversies. Phillips, of course, made
      speeches and distributed leaflets of the statement. But the British
      delegation officially used its veto during one of the main debates against
      a Festival communiqué, stating that the capitalist countries were locked
      in a deepening economic crisis, from which the only escape could be
      profound political and social change. While women's liberationists
      distributed leaflets in Spanish, outlining their demands, which put
      attitudes to homosexuality that clashed sharply with the Cuban view then
      prevailing. (A more relaxed attitude now exists.) However, at no stage did
      the Cuban authorities or the World Preparatory Committee interfere with
      any of this. Other than a mild expression of displeasure by one of the
      Soviet representatives to Phillips at the discourtesy of the British
      delegation statement, there appears to have been only a feeling of
      bewilderment at the antics of the British by a number of delegations at
      the most and, at the least, a general lack of interest in what was largely
      an issue only for some on the British delegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Britain however there was some interest. The Times, in an editorial,
      generally welcomed the British delegation's official position - arguing
      that even the split within the delegation must have been a lesson, though
      a puzzling one, on the freedom to disagree. While the East Midlands
      District Committee of the CPGB was more worried about the affair and wrote
      as much to the YCL EC. The latter however was not impressed by the lesson
      on the right to disagree. Two of its delegates to Havana, one of who was
      from the East Midlands, were
      <q
        >no longer to be allowed to represent the YCL at any outside event, due
        to events that took place in Havana.</q
      >
      \[YCL EC Minutes 14th/15th October 1978\] They had of course been
      associated with the minority statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the trauma of these differences, the British involvement in the
      Festival had been positive and a wide degree of youth unity had been
      achieved around the ideas of world peace and friendship. Many cold war
      barriers had been broken down, but for some the question would naturally
      be posed - at what price for the YCL's own internal unity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Organisations as disparate as the
      <abbr title="British Youth Council">BYC</abbr>, the
      <abbr title="National Union of Students">NUS</abbr>,
      <abbr title="National Organisation of Labour Students">NOLS</abbr>, the
      British Council of Churches, the Student Christian Movement, the National
      Association of Youth Clubs, the Young Liberals, Quakers, the school
      students union, <abbr
              title="Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers (Technical and Supervisory Staffs)"
              >AUEW/TASS</abbr
            >, Young European Left and the YCL had agreed to
      the statement on Détente, Peace and Human Rights. It had been issued in
      their names, not the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr>, however. Even
      though the
      <abbr title="British Preparatory Committee">BPC</abbr> continued its work
      for a short while after the Festival, the YCL was edgy about its continued
      existence and ensured that its influence was brought to bear in winding up
      the organisation.
