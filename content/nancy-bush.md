Nancy Bush

A librettist in her own right of some distinction, she is, alas, better known for being the partner of Alan Bush.

She wrote the inspirational lyrics to Bush's famous opera, \`Wat Tyler, and \`Men of Blackmore' and also produced a diverse range of Brechtian translations, children's opera and the song for International Women's Day.

Also a life-long Communist, Nancy was an enthusiastic member of the Workers Music Association, and she died aged 84 in 1991.
