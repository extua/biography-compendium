Maurice Godfrey

For many years, Maurice Godfrey was a full time official of the staff and managerial union ASTMS (Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs), which later merged with the technical and supervisory union, TASS (Technical and Supervisory Staff), to form MSF (which in term merged with the AEEU to create Amicus).

After retirement, he served as Secretary to the Ealing Trades Council. Active all his life in the Woodcraft Folk, he was a life-long supporter of the Morning Star, and Daily Worker before it, and a member of the Communist Party of Britain.

Godfrey died aged 69 in 1990.
