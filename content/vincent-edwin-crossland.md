Vincent Edwin Crossland

Vince Crossland lived at 23 Burton Street, Bradford. A member of Bradford Young Communist League, he volunteered to serve his country in World War 2 by working as a miner as his form of national service.

One of the so called Bevin boys at Lofthouse Colliery, he sustained fatal injuries at work and died 4th November 1944 aged 19. The local YCL branch, of which he was a member, saw him as dying for "The finest cause in the world".
