Alan Rickman

Alan was born and bred in Birmingham, and joined the Communist Party in 1946 on his return from wartime service. He was a keen cyclist, winning many awards for his speed as a member of Solihull Cycling Club, and a skilled toolmaker and engineer.

He met Irene Hickey, later to become his life partner and wife, Irene Rickman, (see separate entry) through the Party, and was persuaded to try singing when he turned up in his motorbike and sidecar to pick her up from a lesson at the house of Elsie and Martin Marshall. Although protesting he could not sing, with Elsie and Irene’s encouragement, he eventually discovered a rich tenor voice.

It was not long before Alan was persuaded to join the Birmingham Clarion Singers workers' choir by Irene, and he was extremely grateful to Elsie for convincing him he had a voice, and for helping him to find it.

He took on several notable roles; Monostatos in Magic Flute, Hugh in Ralph Vaughan Williams's Hugh the Drover, Matt of the Mint in the Beggar's Opera and various others. He was also popular member of the Old Time Music Hall group and Barbers' Shop Quartet.

He became an excellent stage manager for many of the operatic and dramatic performances of the '50s and also supplied technical help in the Centre 42 workshops.

Alan could regularly be seen on street corners and political events in Birmingham, selling the Morning Star and supporting the West Midlands Pensioners Convention. That was when he wasn’t singing.

As a valued member of the AEU, Alan was given awards of merit by Kings Heath Brandwood Branch, for over 40 years' service as District Committee delegate, Branch President and Trustee.  In later life he treasured these mementos of his many years as an active and influential trade unionist.

With Irene, he continued to attend Birmingham Clarion Singers rehearsals until ill health made it impossible, but they both continued to support Clarion, and were awarded lifetime honorary memberships in 2014. A similar accolade was conferred by the Workers Music Association, in recognition of their contribution to music and the labour movement. Alan celebrated the 75th anniversary of Clarion in the week of his 90th birthday, and quietly sang along to many of his favourite songs during the evening. Music was with him right to the end, still managing to join in, even when his speech had gone. His voice and his quiet, easy manner will live in our memories, and we are thankful for a life lived to the full, and dedicated to an ambition of peace, hope and socialism.

A stalwart Communist Party member and Morning Star supporter to the end, Alan died at the age of 90 in April 2015.
