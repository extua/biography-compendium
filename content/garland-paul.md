Paul Garland

Garland was an active member of the Young Communist League in Bristol during the 1950s and early 1960s.

He was National Chairman of the YCL in 1961 and Secretary of the West of England District.

Once a Queen's Scout in Bristol, he was expelled for being in the Young Communist League in 1954 - an action which produced a great public outcry.

He was also an active trade unionist.

Garland wrote in Challenge in its November 1961 issue that the YCL had been very active in the Anti-Apartheid Movement in Bristol, Nottingham, Manchester, and London.
