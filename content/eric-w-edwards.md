Eric W Edwards

Born on 23 April 1944 in Croydon to Communist parents, Eric was a longstanding member of the British Communist Party in both Surrey and the South Midlands districts, until he was expelled in the mid-1980s by the anti-Soviet "Eurocommunists". 

Prior to attending New College, Oxford as a mature student, Eric worked in a variety of jobs including plumber, electrician, odd job man, and student psychiatric nurse. Throughout his subsequent career and life his thinking remained rooted in an understanding of the class nature of society and the need for the liberation of the working class from class oppression.

He  had an extraordinary knowledge of an extraordinarily wide range of subjects in the human and social sciences and maintained an inspirational  blog site based on many years of study and research, as follows: BA (Hons) Human Sciences, New College, Oxford 1971-74. MA (Oxf) 1987. MPhil (Oxford Brookes) 1992. Oxford University Cert Art Hist (2000). Oxford University Cert Archaeol (2004).

He was a retired attendant and library assistant at the Balfour Library, Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford 2002-2103. One time researcher in osteoarchaeology, and then maritime archaeology. A Pitt Rivers Museum website published contributor, he also provided seminars at Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology, Oxford. 

Eric Edwards died on 13th July 2017.
