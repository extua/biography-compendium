Dr. Alex Tudor Hart was a student at Cambridge where he was taught by, amongst others, John Maynard Keynes. A life-long Communist from that period, he worked as a GP in the Rhondda Valley in Wales.

He served in a field operating theatre during the Spanish civil war. Methods of dealing with fractures and associated wounds after surgery developed by Tudor-Hart and his team in Spain laid the basis for new procedures devloped by him and others, including other Communists, during the Second World war.

Alex Tudor-Hart’s second wife was the Austrian Jewish photographer, Edith Suschitzky, later Edith Tudor-Hart (see separate entry). She is retrospectively rated as one of the most significant documentary photographers working in Britain in the 1930s and 1940s.
