Alfred was one of the hundreds of civil servants who lost their jobs when Attlee cleared all suspected Communists above a certain grade level in the late 1940s.

A stalwart of the Cornish Communist Party, and historian of Cornish matters, Jenkins was also a long-standing and vigorous supporter of the Communist Party musicians’ group. 

Jenkin was the District Secretary for the Communist Party in Cornwall for many years and lived in St Austell.

He died in 1993.
