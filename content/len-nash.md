Len Nash

Nash spent three years in India as a serviceman during the war. On his return he became a supervisory foreman at the King's Cross Goods Yard.

Whilst working there he received a cheque for five pounds five shillings from the Divisional Manager of British Railways for saving a man's life in January 1965. Len pulled a colleague off the tracks to stop him being crushed by a railway carriage.

He became a union representative for the Union of Construction and Allied Trades and Technicians (UCATT). He then worked at the Town Hall in Judd Street, as a uniformed attendant \`gold-braid' until 1988.

Len was a proud member of the Communist Party and was heavily involved in helping the pit-workers during the miners' strike of 1984/5. He helped to arrange meetings and put pressure on the unions to keep up their support during the strikes. His wife, Jean, said his proudest moment came in 1985 when he was made an honorary member of the National Union of Miners in Hatfield on January 1, 1985. Arthur Scargill signed his membership card. She said: "It was something he treasured right until the end."

He met his wife Jean, a Yorkshire woman, during the miners' strike. She was the chairwoman of the Miners Wives' Support Group. They married in 1987 and moved back to her hometown Pontefract in 1988.
