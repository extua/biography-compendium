Wally Ward

A production machine overlooker for the Daily Worker from early on, he had earlier worked for the Daily Herald. Ward was responsible for moving the presses from place to place to escape the government's prohibition on the paper being printed due to its criticism of policy during the early stages of the Second World War. He was also a member of the auxiliary fire service during the London blitz.

In the 1960s, he was sent to the German Democratic Republic to train on polygraph web offset machines, which were installed at the paper - the first of its kind in Fleet Street. Although having retired in the 1974, his devoted to the paper was such that he would come in as a relief on weekends and bank holidays.
