 George Freeland

George Freeland was member of the Communist Party, who taught at Medway school, became headmaster of Alderman Richard Hallam school in Leicester.

He was active in the campaign for comprehensive education in the City during the 1960s – indeed, along with Brian Simon (see separate entry) one of those who laid down a workable strategy for transforming the city’s education. Freeland was also a member and activist of the NUT.
