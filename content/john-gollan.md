 John Gollan                                                                                        

                                                                                          Born 1911, in Edinburgh, of socialist parents, Gollan - a signwriter in his youth - ![](http://79.170.40.183/grahamstevenson.me.uk/images/stories/gollan%20john%202(1).jpg) 

was involved in socialist and Communist Party activity in the city from an

early age. His first political activity was selling bulletins during the 1926

General Strike. He joined the Young Communist League and the Communist

Party in 1927. In July 1931, he was arrested for selling papers to soldiers

and sentenced to six months solitary confinement. A mass campaign

developed in Edinburgh in support of him, culminating in a demonstration

of some 5,000 supporters.  

He went on to be successively editor of the Young Communist Leagues’s

newspaper Challenge in 1932 and General Secretary of the League in 1935.

His book, “Youth in British Industry” (1936) was a choice for the Left Book

Club and was a masterful presentation of data and analysis of fundamental

changes in the workforce that were then affecting youth.

Gollan was Communist Party District Secretary for the North East England

from 1939 and then for Scotland in 1941, during the course of which he wrote

“Scottish Prospect” (1945). He was appointed Assistant General Secretary

of the Party in 1947. From 1949 to 1954 he was assistant editor of the

Daily Worker. The role of National Organiser followed in 1954 and

General Secretary, succeeding Harry Pollitt from 1956-1976.

His retirement was tragically cut short all too soon by terminal illness in 1977, just as he was writing and researching more on the themes of democracy and Marxism that had often so interested him. He was the author of “The British

Political System”. Among the many pamphlets, such as “Victory in  Vietnam”, that he wrote during his long career as a professional revolutionary was “Which Road? Democracy and Class Struggle”. His series of major articles

on Socialist Democracy from January 1976 began a big debate in the Party.

of the British Road to Socialism, being Chair of the drafting commissions in 1952, 1958,

1968 and Secretary of the drafting commission in 1976. For this reason, and his pioneering

vision of socialist democracy that brought him to a critical analysis of the then existing

socialist countries, Gollan was often claimed retrospectively by revisionist adherents

during the inner-party turmoil of the 1980s. Of course, the truth is that no-one can be

certain of what Gollan’s stance would have been had he lived but one thing is very clear,

that he did not reject classical Marxism in the least.
