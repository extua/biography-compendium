Peter Pink

  
Peter Pink was born in 1929 at Stockwell, South London. His father was a policeman, leading to Peter being born in the police wing of Putney hospital. His father was posted to Southall in 1932 and the family consequently moved to Hayes, West Middlesex.

He joined the Young Communist League in 1945 and the Communist Party in 1947 and, in time, became the Secretary of Hayes Communist Party.

Amongst many successful meetings the Communist Party in Hayes organised was one with the Civil Rights leader Sean Morrisey (Chairman of the Turf Lodge Residents Association and education officer of the ATGWU) held in February 1972.

Peter worked at EMI and was Chairman of Hayes branch of the Clerical Workers Union (then CAWU, later APEX, now part of GMB).

For much of this period, Peter lived at 35 Camden Avenue, Hayes, later he moved to 1 Hambledon Close, Hillingdon.

His sister was Labour councillor in Yeading Ward, Hayes.

He was the Advertising Manager of the Morning Star for a while but Peter Pink is perhaps best known for having been the writer of the Morning Star’s daily Peoples’ Press Fighting Fund column during the nineteen eighties and nineties.

Peter died in 2012.
