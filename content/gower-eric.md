A brief biography of Eric Gower

by Graham Stevenson

additions and corrections welcomed: [info@grahamstevenson.me.uk](mailto:info@grahamstevenson.me.uk)

Eric Gower, who had been Secretary of Manchester City Labour Party, stood as Communist candidate for Parliament in a by-election in Stretford, a separate town to Manchester, in late 1939.

The campaign was made more than difficult because of the black-outs and also the electoral truce, whereby the main parties agreed not to fight each other.

A record number of factory gate and street meetings were held and leaflets distributed.

Harry Pollitt worked full-time in the campaign.

Gower polled what was for the Party a respectable 1514 votes, or over 5%.
