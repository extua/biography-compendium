Ted Poole

A Swindon Communist activist who, after the Trade Unions Congress passed Resolution 42 in the early 1960s marking the fact that active trade unionists should be interested in culture, set up with his wife a folk club, which met in the cellar underneath the Swindon Communist Partyâ€™s premises.

Around 1963, the original venue burnt down after a nearby car caught fire and took the building with it.

The club was always a non-profit making venture with an excellent reputation and, having gravitated towards an independent role and another locale, entered in its 45th year of operation in 2010.
