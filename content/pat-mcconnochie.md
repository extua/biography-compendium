Pat McConnochie

A veteran Ayrshire Communist since 1940 and a boilermaker by trade, McConnochie worked in shipyards around the country.

He settled in the London area for a while before returning to Scotland, becoming heavily involved in community politics in Irvine, for example being a founder of a local credit union and campaigning on rents and the poll tax.

He died aged 75 in 1996.
