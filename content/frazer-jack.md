Jack Frazer

John Norman Frazer was a Communist electrician, who joined the Communist Party in 1939.

He became the Secretary of the Party’s electrical advisory in the 1940-50s, taking over from Jack Hendy (see separate entry). 

Frazer was an EC member of the ETU from 1954-61. In the 1957 election for ETU Division 9, Jack Frazer obtained 2003 votes against Les Cannon (see separate entry), who only recently having left the Party, was defeated with 1,451 votes.

Frazer was the centre of allegations concerning the 1959 ETU general secretary election, which went to court in 1961.
