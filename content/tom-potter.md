Tom Potter was one of the pupils of the famous Burston school strike founded in 1914, which was sparked off by the sacking of popular Socialist teachers, Kitty and Tom Higdon; most working people in the agricultural community boycotted the official school and sent their children to the strike school, which lasted for decades.

Tom Potter joined the Communist Party in 1941, became a parish and South Norfolk district councillor and was a branch secretary of the National Union of Agricultural Workers.

He played a major role in reviving the history of the strike, which was led by his elder sister, Violet.

One result of this work was the establishment of a museum devoted to the story of the strike located in the rebel school building.

Potter died aged 70, in 1985.
