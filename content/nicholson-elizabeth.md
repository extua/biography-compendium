Elizabeth Nicholson

Elizabeth Nicholson was the treasurer of Scarborough Communist Party when she died on the 19th October 1945, at 13 Durham Street, Scarborough.

She was clearly a veteran of revolutionary politics, since the Daily Worker recorded that Elizabeth Nicholson's "life was spent in working for the liberation of mankind".Â
