Sam Paddock  
  
Sam Paddock was a Rhondda miner and a Communist. He took part in the Rhondda unemployed march to the TUC, when it was held in Bristol in 1931. Sam's wife Nellie recalled the 1945 General election, when Harry Pollitt came within 972 votes of winning the Rhondda seat.  The Party’s leader fought three elections in the Rhondda.  
  
Nellie stated "Our house was painted red.... I've never seen decorations like there was then - not for the Queen , the Coronation. or anything. Everywhere there were red flags, banner and slogans for Harry, for the Communist Party. During the election campaign every helper who came in, Harry went round in his car and wouldn't go to bed himself till he knew everyone one else was fixed up with a bed.”  
  
Harry Pollitt had been a regular visitor to the Rhondda from the 1920s and was arrested along with Tom Mann at Judges Hall, Trealaw, in 1934 for sedition.  
  
Other Rhonnda Communist miners who paid tribute to the memory of Harry Pollitt in the columns of the Daily Worker on the occasion of his death included Murray Williams and  Jack Thomas of Ynyshir, where Harry had been a regular speaker at the miners’ social club.
