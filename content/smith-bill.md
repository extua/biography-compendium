Bill Smith

Bill Smith was a Communist Party member who was active in Leicester in the 1930s and 40s. He was expelled from the Trades Council in the 1930s for his party membership, presumably arising from the TUC’s \`Black Circular’ urging the banning of delegates who were Communists.

In 1937, Smith became secretary of the 1937 Unity Campaign, between the Communist Party, the ILP, and the Socialist League. This described itself as a _“campaign to strengthen the Labour Party and the Trade Unions in the class struggle, it is a Campaign to mobilise the workers for action now against the National Government, against Fascism, against War.”_

The local Leicester Communist Party banner was inscribed with Bill Smith’s name.
