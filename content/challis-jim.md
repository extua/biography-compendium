Jim Challis

Challis was a Communist engineering worker and AEU activist from Llwdcoed, Aberdare, South Wales.  A council tenants’ leader, he had the experience of having lead numerous delegations and had won a two shillings a week reduction in proposed rents at one point.

Challis had been a AEU shop steward on numerous occasions and stood as the Communist Party candidate for Llwdcoed (pictured) in November 1960, where he hoped to be elected to join fellow Communist and already Llwdcoed Ward councillor, Trevor Williams (see separate entry).
