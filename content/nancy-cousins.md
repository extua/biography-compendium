Nancy Cousins   It is a matter of record that Nancy, the wife of Frank Cousins, the General Secretary of the TGWU from 1955-68, was a fully-fledged, card carrying member of the Communist Party’s Yorkshire District from 1942-44, when her husband was working as a local union official servicing road transport haulage workers in Doncaster.   It is claimed that she allowed her membership to lapse in the interests of not impairing her husband’s career, since it was becoming clear as the war neared its end that the more fanatically anti-Communist Arthur Deakin would assume leadership of the union whilst Ernest Bevin sought a political career.   It is further alleged by those who knew her than Nancy never quite lost her inkling for the Party.
