Sid Nash

A life-long Communist, Nash was, for many decades, an activist in USDAW, the shop and distributive workers' union, along with his wife, Dora, and a particularly successful player at the union's national policy-making conference.

A Morning Star supporter of some note, he died aged 89 in 1991.
