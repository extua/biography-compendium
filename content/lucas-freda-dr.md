Dr Freda Lucas

Dr Freda Lucas stood for the Communist Party at the Hackney Council in 1945 along with William Rust Editor of the Daily Worker, Henry Henkin, Mrs Bronawski and Maurice Blastin.  
  
The key issue at this election was housing with the Communist Party highlighting the fact that nine thousand families were on the waiting list for accommodation and half the population lived in overcrowded rooms. Repairs to bomb damaged houses were negligible.  
  
The Communist Party had councillors in Hackney for a number of years during the 1940s and 1950s.
