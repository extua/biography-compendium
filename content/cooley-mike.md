Mike Cooley _(pictured in 1961)_ was born in Ireland and became a well-studied professional engineer.

From the 1960s, he was active in the AESD, the draughtsmen’s union that led to TASS, the technical workers. For a short period, he was a member of the British Communist Party but quickly became associated with the political trend represented by Reg Birch (see separate entry).

Later, he became known for his involvement in the alternative production plan produced by shop stewards at Lucas Aerospace in the late 1970s. Cooley was chair of the TASS branch there but had left by the early 80s.

He has widely published and been guest university lecturer and adviser to a range of institutions.
