Sid Booth first came into politics at the age of 16 years old, during the general strike, when he worked for the LMS Railways.

He attended his first ever union march in Manchester with workmates that culminated in a huge meeting held in Platt Fields. After the strike was ended, not all the strikers were taken back immediately and Sid was out of work for five weeks before he was started back.

He joined the Communist Party, of which he was a life-long member and served in the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.

Afterwards, he worked in the Manchester engineering industry and became a leading and active local member of the AEU.

Sid, as a passionate amateur artist, was a founder member of Manchester Unity of Arts Society in 1971, and its first chairman.
