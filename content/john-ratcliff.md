John Ratcliff

After retiring from banking, John Ratcliffe went to work as a volunteer for the Morning Star in the events department.

Since stamp collecting was one of his passions, one of his task was to organise the collection of foreign stamps from supporters that was a minor but useful source of free revenue for the paper. Inevitably, he became known as “John Stamp”!

After leaving the events department, John worked for the paper’s library for a further 15 years on a twice a week basis.

Ratcliff was a member of the Communist Party for over 20 years and died aged 85 in 1989.
