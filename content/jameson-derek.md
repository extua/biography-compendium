Derek Jameson

Perhaps a little peculiar to place within a collection of mostly interesting and admirable Communists and ex-Communists, Jameson is much more well-known for being notorious as the editor of the News of the World, a Sunday scandal-sheet, in the 1980s and, later, as a media \`personality’.

However, reliable information suggests that Jameson, who was born in 1929, began his journalistic career writing for \`Challenge’, the Young Communist League journal in 1946.

His \`attachment’ to the YCL appears not to have lasted more than 18 months at the most.
