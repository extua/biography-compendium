Harry Bould

Bould was a Communist ETU activist, heavily involved in presenting cases for representation at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance for members at Cheadle in Cheshire for over six years before being banned from holding office in the general prohibition of Communists from 1965.

He had joined the union in 1936 and had been secretary of the Manchester Electronic Engineers branch from 1950 and area president from 1956, and shop steward in an inspection department of a factory in Cheshire since 1954. He had been a delegate to the unionâ€™s conference six times.
