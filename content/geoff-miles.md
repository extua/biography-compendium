Geoff Miles

Geoff Miles was first elected as Communist councillor for Garndiffaith in 1956. This is a village located in [Torfaen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torfaen "Torfaen"), Gwent, in south east [Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales"), a few miles north of Pontypool and now part of it.

In 1958, reflecting on his election, Miles stated that “The basis for victory was laid by years of consistently selling the Daily Worker in the ward, and taking up issues the people are concerned about, no matter how trivial they may have appeared.”

In the late 1980s, Geoff Miles was still a Communist councillor and, as President of the men-only local bowling club worked hard to assist the women of the village found their own club, being honoured by being made their President also.

Miles died in 1991, aged 84, having served for 35 years as a Communist councillor.
