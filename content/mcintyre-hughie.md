Hughie McIntyre

Hughie McIntyre was a Communist County Councillor for Bonhill in the Vale of Leven, West Dunbartonshire, for over 20 years until he was defeated in 1952.

In December 1935 he had ousted Sir Iain Colquhoun from the chairmanship of the Vale of Leven District Council after the local elections in November had seen Labour and Communist candidates take a commanding majority.  McIntyre went on the become one of the leading figures in improving housing and education in the Vale at that time.

McIntyre Terrace is a short piece of Dalvait Road in Balloch, built at the same time as the rest of the Dalvait Estate in the early 1970s, which is named after this pioneering councillor. As is noted by a site devoted to local history – especially the street names of the area - from which this information is gleaned, it’s ironic that those who have made the greatest contribution to the common good in the Vale of Leven "have the shortest stretches of road named after them"!
