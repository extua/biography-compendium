Frank Bates

An active member of the Communist Party in Coventry, Bates was a member of the AEU. While not very active in the branch due to his health, he had been Party literature secretary.

He suffered from poor health and died at the age of 60 in the Gulson Road Hospital on April 30th 1935.

The Daily Worker reported that: "He had been in very poor health for some time and died of cardiac disease, the pain from which had caused him to cut his throat".

Given this was pre NHS days and therefore affordable access to health care and pain killing drugs, one can only imagine the pain Bates was in to be forced to attempt to take his own life

He left a son and daughter
