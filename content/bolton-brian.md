Brian Bolton

A life-long Communist, Brian Bolton started his working life as a telecommunications engineer, later winning a scholarship to Ruskin and taking a degree at SussexUniversity. His specialism was the growth of trans-national corporations.

In the early 1980s, he joined the T&G national research department and assisted in trying to modernise its approach to company information. He produced an authoritative report on Courtaulds and was involved in TUC work on anti-apartheid issues.

When the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers joined the T&G, he became researcher to the newly formed Agricultural Trade Group. He transformed the approach to the Agricultural Wages Board claim and negotiations.

Later, he became a consultant to Ruskin College Research Unit and the Post and Telecom International Trade Secretariat, and moved to live in the Welsh Borders. Brian Bolton died relatively young in 1997.
