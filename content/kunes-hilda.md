Hilda Kunes

An active Communist Party member in the early 1950, Hilda Kunes was elected to the Communist Party’s national executive committee in 1954 at the 23rd Congress.

She was one of seven women elected onto the EC, included Nora Jeffrey, Eleanor Burns, Betty Matthews, Ida Hackett, Eve Cohen and Frances Dean.

Kunes wrote an article on women’s magazines in the workplace: "Reading in the tea break" "The fact that these magazines are read by millions gives an indication of the power and influence they have on the minds and actions of very large number of working class women." She finished by calling for more good stories for magazines such as Daylight and Woman Today.
