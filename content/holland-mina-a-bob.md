Mina and Bob Holland

Wilhelmina, or "Mina", and Robert Holland were a husband and wife team who were foundation members of the Communist Party.

Originally from Tyneside, both took part in several hunger marches in the north-east of England during the 1920s and the Great Depression. Soon after they gravitated to Fulham, West London, in search of work, and stayed for thirty years.

Minna, especially, was a devoted Daily Worker supporter and for many years a familiar figure in Fulham selling the paper. She died after a short illness on 27th March 1961 and Bob also having only recently passed away, the couple had a joint funeral at Putney Vale Cemetery, South London, on the 4th April 1961.
