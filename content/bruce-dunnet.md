Bruce Dunnet

Born in Edinburgh, Dunnet moved to London in the post-Second World War period. He became renowned there as a street corner orator for the Communist Party.  

Even more notably, he played a significant role in the folk revival of the 1950s. Dunnet presented the “Bein’ Behan” cabaret at the Edinburgh Festival. This later inspired the Establishment Club and the TV satire programme, “That was the Week that Was”, in the early 1960s. 

He organised a concert at the Festival Hall to celebrate the life of Ewan McColl during the 1984 miners’ strike and died at the age of 78.
