George Halkett

George Halkett was a Communist County Councillorin the Vale of Leven \* during the 1930s and 1940s.

Halkett Crescent in Alexandria’s Rosshead Estate was built in the early 1960s and is named after the Communist councillor.

The crescent forms one half of the road which circles Rosshead, the other being named after Sir Iain Colquhoun, about as far away from a Communist as it is possible to get.

Sir Iain was a leading closet Tory (masquerading as an Independent) and contemporary of George Halkett on the Council.
