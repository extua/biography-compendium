Born in London on February 26th 1917, he joined the Communist Party during the Second World War. He met his wife, Sadie, also a Party member in 1942. In 1948, Max gave up a good professional career as a cutter and designer to become a full-time organiser of the Communist Party in the then major industrial area of Hendon, north London but later formally as the North West Area Organiser. 

Never a physically robust man, arising perhaps from a collapsed lung experienced at an early age, it was typical that he was known for mountain climbing, hill walking and similar pursuits.

He went on to become a London district organiser, a post he held until his retirement in 1982. He then became the librarian at Marx memorial Library until 1989.  (See undated story from the Morning Star below.) He died in early 1996, not quite 79 years old.
