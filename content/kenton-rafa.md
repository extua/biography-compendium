Rafa Kenton  
  
She was married to Lou Kenton (see separate entry), former International Brigader, in 1941. During the 1940s, she was a full-time organiser for the London Young Communist League (YCL).

At the London Communist Party Congress of 1947, held at Hammersmith town hall on the 4th and 5th October, she said: â€œI am sorry comrades, but there is no miraculous solution and no secret formula on building a YCL that does not apply to building the party. The very first thing in building a YCL is the question of cadres. We need the allocation of young responsible adult comrades to work in the League as YCLers and not just fatherly or motherly advisers to the YCLers."
