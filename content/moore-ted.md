Ted Moore

Ted Moore was a miner who worked at the colliery in Shipley in the East Midlands.

The Communist Party’s candidate for Heanor Rural District Council (now part of Amber Valley) in 1952, he secured 220 votes, 120 per cent increase on his previous vote.

Moore was to stand again and again in local elections during his long-standing and very loyal membership of the Party. He supported the CPGB EC during the difficulties of the 1980s.
