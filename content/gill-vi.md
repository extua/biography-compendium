  Vi (or Violet) Gill worked as a point grinder at Firth Brown Tools in Sheffield. An active trade unionist in    the AEU and its descendants for all of her working life she actively campaigned for better pay and conditions for all workers. Vi was the first female trade union deputy convenor at Fyrth Brown Engineers, the factory that was George Caborn’s (see separate entry) power base. She was for a time a member of the Party’s EC and also stood as a candidate in Sheffield Central for the Communist Party in the 1983 general election but did not support the trend associated with the assault on the Morning Star from 1984.     _Sources:_ [http://www.sywdtindustry.org.uk/vi-gill.php](http://www.sywdtindustry.org.uk/vi-gill.php)  _Plus GS personal knowledge_
