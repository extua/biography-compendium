Mikola Januszewicz

A member of the Communist Party of Britain on his death and he had also been a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, before he left over its late revisionism.

During the war he had been a young Byelorussian partisan. Born near Minsk, he had also served with the Polish Red Army, the Maquis and the British 8th Army. He spoke many European languages fluently and could also translate from many more.

Januszewicz played an active part in many CND-related campaigns during the 1980s and was an active member of Scottish CND.

He gained a great fondness for Scottish people and for Scotland although his passion for his native land was strong right to the end.
