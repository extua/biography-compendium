Born Margaret Lang, she was an activist in the Good Templar’s Movement, an alcohol abstinence organisation for whole families.

The wife of Bob Stewart, she died on 14th March 1950. Overshadowed all her adult life by her famous husband, she was in fact herself a foundation member of the Communist Party.  
   
Of her welcoming to the incessant visitors to her house, whether in Dundee or in London, it was said that: "Her hospitality was unbounded and her friendship was treasured by all those who were privileged to know her."
