Bob Darke

A bus conductor who joined the Party at the age of 22, Darke is most known as the former elected Hackney borough councillor for the Communist Party, who turned on the Party.

After 18 years membership of the Party, out of the blue and spectacularly, in 1951 he had a Penguin Special book ghost-written for him but published in his name called The Communist Technique in Britain. This purported to be an expose of underhand methods adopted by the British Party. Basically, it complained at the heavy degree of discipline and hard work that was required to be a serious Communist. This damaging book was widely quoted by mainstream media at the time.

He later also had published \`Cockney Communist’, a sort of biography, that he also does not seem to have written.
