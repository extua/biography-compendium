Maire Gaster

Maire attributed her early passion for social justice to her Socialist father, Robert Lind, once a well-known essayist for the New Statesman and the News Chronicle.

She was already a member of the Communist Party in her youth, to which she remained loyal, when she met and later married then ILPer, Jack Gaster (see separate entry) who also joined the Party.

An avid letter writer in the 1930s, Maire was especially noted as a peace campaigner in the 1950s.

In later life, she became fairly well-known as a CND activist.

Maire Gaster died, aged 78, in 1990.
