Born around 1876, Todd Sloan was a London docker’s leader, who was arrested during the 1926 General Strike.

During the early 1930s, he was much involved in the NUWM and unemployed campaigning in the east end of London.

Later in the 1930s, he left the Communist Party, found God and gravitated to Frank Buchman’s Oxford group, which mutated later in the virulently anti-communist Moral Re-Armament. 

Sloan then announced that he had been mistaken when he campaigned for the poor and homeless, and to get schoolchildren meals and boots, because he had “made materialists out of them.” A moral lesson, indeed!
