Avis began working for the Observer in the 1960s and was with it on an off until 2003.

In the 1970s he was a reporter for the Morning Star, becoming its diplomatic correspondent.

In the 1980s, he edited the journal of the ACTT, the film technicians' union and spent the next three decades moving across the Channel, being based in Brighton when in Britain.

He was London correspondent of the French Communist paper, L'Humanité. A long association with Dieppe followed and, after his death, the Communist-led council in the town named a small square after him. 

A long-standing member of the Communist Party, he followed the revisionist tendency in the CPGB and ultimately ended up supporting the Green Party in Brighton.

He died at the age of 83.
