Harry Hunter was so well known, respected and liked in his home town of Holytown in Scotland that he was, towards the end of his life, the winner of Holytown Community Council and Gala Day Citizen of the Year competition.  

Harry was known as the "Laird of Holytown" and respected by one and all. The District Council named a street after him in recognition of his work in the community. One of the finest Marxists and organisers of his day, as Communist Councillor Jimmy Sneddon (see separate entry) would testify, since Harry was the driving force in Jimmy's election campaigns.

He was himself latterly chair of the Community council and a life-long Communist.
