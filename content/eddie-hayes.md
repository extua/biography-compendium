Eddie Hayes

Eddie Hayes joined the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union (which later became APEX and then merged with the GMB) in 1938 and was active in his union until shortly before his death. He was a branch secretary for 50 years and held a variety of lay posts at all levels in the union.

In a union always known for its right wing position within the labour movement, Hayes was well respected even though he was a life-long Communist and, as a pensioner activist, was awarded the union's gold badge.

He was involved in the Grunwick dispute as an executive member of APEX, the union that represented the strikers. Hayes was also a member of the committee of the Marx Memorial Library for ten years and its vice-chair for five of those years. Eddie Hayes died in October 1994.
