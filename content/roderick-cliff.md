Cliff Roderick

Clifford Roderick was a Communist Party member in Port Talbort, South Wales who joined the Party in 1938.

President of his local branch of Electricians Trades union for fourteen years, he was forced to resign as President in January 1965 because of the ban on Communists holding office in the ETU introduced by the new right wing leadership of the union.

He had come to the Party very much as a result of his union experiences, as he put it himself: "It was as a trade unionist that I first began to realise the class nature of our society"
