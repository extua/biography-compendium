Norman Berry

Norman Berry was a leading activist for the Communist Party in Halifax and aÂ well known fighter for the working class in the town. He had been an officer in army but found he was often ostracised due to his not having been Sandhurst educated, even to the extent of having to eat alone.

He famously helped residents fight the noise produced by a local factory by ingeniously securing a noise meter to prove his point, so as to get the local council to take the issue seriously.
