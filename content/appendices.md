1953-5                        T J Potts (AESD)                                         Alex Chisholm (NUAW)

This period is marked by many changes and requires explanation. Chisholm beat Miss N Middleton, CAWU, in 1953 for the Vice-Presidency by 45-30 votes and again in 1954 by 45-38. Also, Cassidy had become a councillor and consequently left the post of President due to pressure of work. To replace him, Potts beat Cyril Bradley of the TGWU by 38 to 37 votes. A clear left-right divide had emerged since the removal of Potts, a Communist, in 1948. But, increasingly, the left began to argue for some legitimacy by seeking the Vice-Presidency, or some other share in the leadership.

1956                           A Chisholm                                      J R Scherer (USDAW)

1957                           J R Scherer                                      G A Fearn (NUR)                            

This year saw a contested vote; the Communist Doug Coleman (NUVB) lost 15 to 51 with 5 abstentions to Scherer, Les Wallis (NUGMW) lost 28 votes to 45 to Fearn.)

1958                           J R Scherer                                      G A Fearn (NUR)                                                          

In this year's contested vote for the presidency, Scherer beat Les Wallis (NUGMW) 50 votes to 15, in what was presumably a poorly thought out left-right contest. There was also a contest for the vice-presidency; Fearn beat G Perry (NUR) by 20 votes 40. In April, Scherer left for full-time union work in London for USDAW, Fearn took over and T E Moore (NUR) became Vice-President, after beating Les Wallis by 25 votes to 21, F E Wilson taking 9 votes.

1961-2            W Simms (CEU)                                          L W Dudley (NUR)

During 1955, the elected Secretary, Charles Howell (NUR) was elected an MP, the election for his successor was strongly fought, Celia Butcher beating Jim Potts by 46 to 42 votes. But during 1956 she married a Mr G Williams and moved away to Stroud. The Assistant Secretary's post then went to D Cassidy, who initially took over from Celia Butcher (now Williams). But a vote was pressed for and took place in October, when T J Potts narrowly beat Cassidy, 35 votes to 31 with 5 spoilt papers.

YEAR                                                         STATUTE/JUDGEMENT                   RESUMÉ

1799-1800: COMBINATION ACTS - Any attempt to increase wages or shorten hours of work became a criminal offence with immediate imprisonment imposed by magistrates. Combinations in all trades prohibited; only friendly societies were permitted.

1823: CONSOLIDATION OF THE MASTER AND SERVANT ACT - If a worker left his job without giving notice he could be jailed for six months, but an employer could sack workers without notice.

1824: COMBINATION LAWS REPEAL ACT - Combining to raise wages no longer a criminal offence.

1825: COMBINATIONS OF WORKMEN ACT - A series of strikes and violent actions led to severe restrictions on unions; prohibited strikes, intimidation, molestation and obstruction aimed at forcing a worker to leave work, to join a union or to prevent him/her from accepting employment, or to force an employer to alter the way the business was conducted. Permitted workmen to combine only for the purpose of regulating wages and hours.

1831: TRUCK ACT - Prohibited payment of wages in any other form than money and removed restrictions on how or where a worker spent wages; reinforcing the 1464 Truck Act.

1833: FACTORY ACT - Related to textile mills, where mechanical power was used. It limited the working hours of children under 13 years to nine a day, or 48 per week and, between the ages 13 and 18, to 12 a day, or 69 per week. Holidays for both groups were made compulsory and factory inspectors were introduced.

1847: TEN HOURS ACT - Prevented women and young persons from working over ten hours per day in textile factories.

1851: DUFFIELD & ROWLANDS - Trade unionists imprisoned for peacefully going on strike, described as ‘conspiracy’ to molest and obstruct their employer.

1867: HORNBY & CLOSE - Trade unions unlawful because they were ‘in restraint of trade’ at common law.

1867: REGINA v DRUITT - Picketing, declared by a judge, to, be a conspiracy to molest if ‘calculated to have a deterring effect on the minds of ordinary persons’.

1867: MASTER AND SERVANT ACT - A worker could be imprisoned for ‘aggravated misconduct’, but breach of contract was now a civil and not a criminal matter.

1871: TRADE UNION ACT - Unions no longer illegal at common law simply because their purpose was to restrain trade. Protected union funds. Trade unions no longer ‘criminal conspiracies’.

1871: CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT - Violence, threats, intimidation, molestation and obstruction of any person in order to coerce him or her for trade purposes were subject to severe penalties.

1871: BANK HOLIDAYS ACT - Adds Boxing Day, Easter Monday, Whit Monday and the first Monday in August to the only legal right for holidays for all, which existed under common law, for Christmas Day and Good Friday only.

1872: REGINA v BUNN - Organisers of London gas strike imprisoned for twelve months for criminal conspiracy to coerce the employers to carry on their business contrary to their will (to obtain the reinstatement of a worker), an ‘unjustifiable annoyance to masters’.

1875: CONSPIRACY AND PROTECTION OF PROPERTY ACT - Repealed the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1871. Legalised picketing and excluded from legal action “in furtherance of a trade dispute”, unless it was an action punishable as a crime, e.g. it was a crime for employees in gas and water undertakings to break a contract of service, if life would be endangered, bodily injury caused, or valuable property destroyed as a result of any action.

1875: EMPLOYERS AND WORKMEN ACT - Abolished discrimination against a worker in a case of breach of contract. Made the contract of employment a purely civil contract into which employees entered on an equal basis with employers. Allowed courts to adjust claims for damages or wages and enabled an employer to claim damages against a worker who was absent contrary to a contract.

1876: REGINA v BAULD - Judge holds peaceful picketing to be a crime.

1876: TRADE UNION AMENDMENT ACT - Defined a trade union as ‘any combinations, whether temporary or permanent, for regulating the relations between workmen and masters, or between workmen and workmen, or between masters and masters, or for imposing restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business’.

1887: TRUCK AMENDMENT ACT - Extended protection to all manual workers who manufactured goods direct to dealers, by placing them in the same category as wage earners.

1892: Circulation of lists of strikers and ‘trouble-makers’ by employers is held not to be illegal, by being in employers’ legitimate self-interest.

1896: Trade unionists who posted lists of strike breakers held liable for ‘conspiracy to injure’.

1896: LYONS v WILKINS - Court of Appeal judges decide that picketing to persuade people not to work is unlawful. Lord Justice Lindley says: “You cannot make a strike effective without doing more than is lawful”.

1896: TRUCK ACT - Enabled deductions to be made from workers’ wages in respect of disciplinary fines, bad work or damage to employers’ property and for the supply and use of such things as specified tools and material.

1897: WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION ACT - Covered certain classes of employment and gave workers the right the right to compensation without having to supply proof of their employers’ negligence.

1901: TAFF VALE v AMALGAMATED SOCIETY OF RAILWAY SERVANTS - Judges of the House of Lords decide that unions themselves are liable to be sued in industrial action. ASRS ordered to pay the colossal sum of £23,000 damages, plus legal costs.

1906: TRADES DISPUTES ACT - Passed by a Liberal Government following a mass trade union campaign. Trade unions protected from being sued for damages. Industrial action ‘in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute’ protected. Employers no longer able to sue for tort of ‘civil conspiracy’ and ‘inducing breaches of contracts of employment’ in trade disputes. Redefined the right to picket.

1909: AMALGAMATED SOCIETY OF RAILWAY SERVANTS v OSBORNE - House of Lords ruled that a union had no power to collect and administer funds for political purposes. This made all political action by trades unions illegal.

1913: TRADE UNION ACT - Empowered a union to include in its constitution any lawful purpose, so long as its principal objects were those of a trade union according to the 1876 Act. Permitted unions to establish separate political funds, if a majority of members agreed in a ballot and if members could ‘contract out’ of the political levy.

1915: MUNITIONS OF WAR ACT - All industries engaged in supplying the needs of war were subject to compulsory arbitration and suspension of restrictive practices, on condition that the previous circumstances were restored after the war.

1920: EMERGENCY POWERS ACT - Faced with widespread industrial unrest, the Government sought to secure the supply and distribution of food, water, fuel, light and to maintain transport and public safety. But it did not make strikes illegal.

1926: GENERAL STRIKE - The Government claims the strike to be illegal and unconstitutional, despite it being in furtherance of the miners’ pay and hours dispute

1927: TRADES DISPUTES & TRADE UNION ACT - Following the General Strike of 1926, this made illegal any strike or lock-out which went beyond the purposes of a trade dispute - by trying to coerce the Government - either directly or by inflicting hardship upon the community. It was also made illegal to use funds in furtherance of an illicit strike or lock-out. Local or other public authorities were no longer able to make it a condition that any person employed by the authority, or by a contractor working for the authority, should or should not be a member of a trade union. Banned ‘sympathetic’ strikes and made it a crime for persons to incite others to join an illegal strike. In regard to political funds, ‘contracting out’ was replaced by ‘contracting in’. Civil servants were banned from joining a union with political objects and civil service unions were banned from affiliation with any industrial or political organisation, including the TUC. A local or public authority employee who broke his or her contract of service, knowing that they might endanger or gravely inconvenience the community, could be prosecuted.

1940: CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT & NATIONAL ARBITRATION ORDER - Prohibited strikes and lockouts, unless a dispute had been submitted to the Minister of Labour and had not been referred by the Minister, for settlement within 21 days. Established a National Arbitration Tribunal to settle disputes, only if they could not be resolved through voluntary negotiation or where suitable joint machinery did not exist. The Tribunal decisions were binding.

1945: WAGES COUNCIL ACT - Repealed the 1909 Acts and set up Wages Councils, where joint machinery was lacking or not effective. With tripartite representation, the Councils had power to prescribe minimum wages and holidays with pay. The Act was intended to support voluntary wage bargaining and a Council could be removed by joint application from both sides of an industry, if it was considered no longer necessary.

1946: TRADE DISPUTES AND TRADE UNIONS ACT - The incoming Labour Government repealed the 1927 Act and restored the position to what it was before the General Strike. A change to ‘contracting out’ of the political levy took place, except in Northern Ireland where ‘contracting in’ was retained.

1946: GENERAL SOCIAL LEGISLATION - The Labour Government introduced:- a new National Insurance Act, covering all classes of the community; a new Industrial Injuries Act; an improved Old Age Pension Act; a National Assistance Act, which swept away the old Poor Law; a comprehensive free National Health Service.

1951: INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ORDER - Wartime prohibition of strikes was rescinded after prosecution of unofficial leaders of gas and dock strikes lead to demonstrations. The Industrial Disputes Tribunal was established for settlement of disputes by compulsory arbitration and to legally enforce collective agreements.

1959: TERMS OF CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT ACT - Wages Councils established to submit to the Ministry of Labour proposals for fixing minimum wages, holidays and conditions of work in certain trades or industries where suitable joint negotiating machinery did not exist (catering, road haulage, agriculture, tailoring, retail foods trade, hairdressing etc). Tripartite representation on Councils and the Minister could not reject or amend proposals.

1960: PAYMENT OF WAGES ACT - Provided for payment of wages of a manual worker into a bank account, if the worker requested it and the employer agreed.

1961: FACTORIES ACT - Consolidated the 1901 Factory Workshops Act and the 1937 Factories Act.

1963: TRADE UNION AMALGAMATION ACT - This Act made it easier for unions to amalgamate, by only requiring a simple majority of members of the unions concerned.

1963: CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT ACT - This Act, effective from 6th July 1966, had two principal objectives: 1) to provide that employees receive notice based on length of service, ranging from one week for six months to two years continuous employment; two weeks for two to five years employment and four weeks for five years service and over: 2) to ensure that employees are given, in writing, particulars of the main terms and conditions of employment and any changes that may take place.

1963: OFFICES, SHOPS & RAILWAY PREMISES ACT - Wide scope of control over working conditions incorporating:- Health: cleanliness, overcrowding, temperature, ventilation, sanitation; Safety: guarding of machinery, safe access to work, fumes, fire escapes; Welfare: drinking water, seating, first-aid, industrial diseases.

1964: ROOKES v BARNARD - House of Lords’ judges invent new civil wrong of ‘intimidation’ to bypass 1906 Act protections. Anyone threatening a strike is liable to be sued.

1965: TRADES DISPUTES ACT - Parliament gives protection to those threatening strike action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.

1965: STRATFORD v LINDLEY - House of Lords’ judges extend liability of union officials for inducing breaches of commercial contracts in the course of industrial action.

1965: REDUNDANCY PAYMENTS ACT - Introduced the concept of compensation based on service and age for a genuine redundancy situation, provided certain conditions applied.

1968: RACE RELATIONS ACT - Discrimination is made illegal in the areas of housing, employment and services. Complaints, however, were to be dealt with by the process of conciliation and voluntary agreement. The membership of a Race Relations Board and Community Relations Commission were appointed by Government.

1968: DONOVAN ROYAL COMMISSION ON TRADE UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS’ ASSOCIATIONS - Report recommends extending legal protection to those inducing breaches of commercial contracts in trade disputes and debates wide-ranging legal review of industrial relations.

1969: TORQUAY HOTEL CO. LIMITED v COUSINS - Lord Denning in Court of Appeal decides that interfering with commercial contracts is unlawful, even if no breach of contract occurs.

1970: EQUAL PAY ACT - Operative only in 1975. Outlaws sexual discrimination in forms of pay, holidays, sickness etc. Work of broadly similar or equal value must be rewarded by an equal wage where the same or associated employer is concerned.

APPENDIX SIX

A NOTE ON INFLATION

Inflation is overwhelmingly a 20th century phenomenon. The Retail Price Index began in 1914, as the Cost of Living Index, has recorded a 50-fold increase in prices since that period. Half a crown (12.5p) would buy a large loaf, a pint of milk, 1 lb of beef, a quarter pound of tea, six eggs and a 1 lb of sugar and still leave change for a tram ride home! Such a shopping basket might now cost nearer £7. Back then, 2d bought a pint of beer and 4d a packet of twenty cigarettes. Oddly, some commodities are cheaper in real terms (e.g. bacon and eggs) and some are dearer (e.g. - and surprisingly - beer, cigarettes, cars, lamb), testifying to the difficulties in making serious comparisons.

The RPI in 1914 showed a typical family spending 60% of its income on food, today the proportion might be one quarter of that. In 1956, such an expenditure would have been a little over one third of income. The picture, therefore, is one of the working class increasing its share of wealth by virtue of both changes in technology and methods of delivery of service in the period covered by this study. Not all of the changes are necessarily obvious benefits. Motoring costs, allied to a big shift in retail purchasing behaviour, increasingly become an enormous part of working class expenditure in the post-1945 period and confuse attempts at correlations. Arguably, this change in consumer purchasing methods has been transformed from paid employment of one section of the labour force into a supposedly leisure activity by us all.

The API has changed a great deal in an attempt to recognise these factors. Coffee, wine and sherry did not join the index until recent decades. Candles and rubber mangles (once an indispensable aid to home washing) stayed in the API formula until the late 1950s. But until 1947 the RPI recorded what was considered essential, not what was actually spent. Alcohol and other ‘luxury’ goods made an appearance. A measure of the unscientific, even unrealistic outlook adopted by statisticians and the politicians who controlled them is that sanitary towels also then made their first appearance. Strangely, this wider acceptance of ‘non-essential' spending also revealed inflation, perhaps it had always been with us? Certainly, capitalism entered the modern world committed to a strategy of mass consumerism and the API has since been re-jigged several times to take into account new fads.

Making comparisons with prices and monetary amounts over many decades is thus extremely difficult. According to the Central Statistical Office, prices have risen by an average of 5% a year since 1914. Prices rose two and a half times between 1914 and 1920. Between the wars, prices doubled, but since 1945 they have increased more than twenty-fold. In the process, the 1914 pound has shrunk to 2p or 3p in purchasing power. In making general assumptions in the text, it has been necessary to seek to convey a sense of the proportions involved, rather than attempt to make a currency conversion. In so doing, the value of monetary sums has usually been related to the prevailing normal working class wage.
